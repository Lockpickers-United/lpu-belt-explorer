### Q: What is the Scorecard anyway?

Scorecard is a major overhaul of the “Recorded” list in LPUbelts collections. Instead of just keeping track of the locks you’ve recorded, you can now capture all the information used in the Dan Sheet. That includes: Lock, Date Picked, Link to Documentation, Modifiers (like First Recorded Pick), as well as Notes if you wish to add them.

Scorecard also implements the Dan scoring system for Black Belt pickers and calculates exact Dan Points based on locks with documentation, including modifiers and upgrades. Moving forward, you can use a link to your scorecard as evidence for Dan Level requests.

We hope Scorecard will become the official successor to the Dan Sheet but for now both systems are active and can be used for tracking your picks and projects as well as requesting Dan Levels through #belt-requests.

Worth noting: because the Scorecard and the Dan Sheet cannot be actively connected, changes in one place are not reflected in the other. It’s best to choose one or the other though of course you can keep both up-to-date. All of your lock and project additions can be made on lpubelts.com, and Dan Requests would reference your lpubelts.com Scorecard.

### Q: What are the main benefits of the Scorecard?

Well… It’s built on the foundation of lpubelts.com.

- You can use all the features of the site to easily find locks to add to your record. You can search, sort, filter, and view complete details of any lock in the Ranking system (and a lot that aren’t yet).

- The full catalog of information and images is available, no more scrolling through a gigantic list in a spreadsheet to find your lock.

- The site, and your Scorecard, update automatically any time there’s a change in ranking and new additions become available immediately.

- Your Dan Points are calculated precisely and automatically, including upgrades and there’s no more guesswork involved in what’s an upgrade or not.

- Everything is laid out – and graphed out – so it’s easy to see your accomplishments at a glance. That includes locks picked, projects and when you first got your Black Belt.

- Your privacy and your scorecard data are protected. And you can export your data at any time if you want to take it with you.

- We’ve just launched a Black Belt Leaderboard and Comparison so you can see how you match up. (You can opt out, of course)

- Everything else we do to improve the information and functionality of the site is immediately available.

### Q: Is the Scorecard acceptable as evidence for Dan Level requests?

Yes. Simply include a link to your scorecard in a standard Dan Level request. Paste this link into #belt-requests, so your post should look something like this:

\`@LPUBeltBot request 8th Dan https://lpubelts.com/#/profile/[YourID]/scorecard\`

The mods will receive your request, reviewing your Scorecard similar to how they previously reviewed your Google dan sheet. And they will respond just as before, in #belt-requests.

### Q: Do I need to create an account on LPUbelts to use it?

You do, just as you do to edit your Dan Sheet. You can use the exact same Google account as you do for the Dan Sheet if you don’t already have an LPUbelts profile.

### Q: How do I get my existing Dan Sheet record into the Scorecard?

It’s easy! We’ve built an automated import that does all the work for folks who have a tab in the Dan Sheet already. Simply hit the “Import Dan Sheet” button, identify your tab, and we’ll do the rest. Complete details can be found at https://lpubelts.com/#/profile/scorecard/howto

### Q: What if I'm new and/or don't have a Dan sheet tab?

Simply send us your LPUbelts display name along with a link to your Black Belt announcement, and we'll set you up in the system.

### Q: How do I add new entries to my Scorecard?

For new locks, find the lock on the lpubelts.com site, and click the “My Collection” button. There is a new checkbox for “Scorecard”. By checking this box, a form will appear where you can input all the information. Once you save this form, a new entry for this lock will appear on your Scorecard.

For new projects, go to the top of your Scorecard and click on the “Add Project” button. Similar to adding a new lock, a form will appear where you can input all the information. Once you save this form, your project will appear on your Scorecard.

### Q: Do changes to my Dan Sheet automatically show up on LPUbelts?

No. The Dan Sheet cannot be actively synced to the LPUbelts, because the Dan Sheet uses a separate classification approach that is not tightly connected to what the classification team manages. We took a snapshot of the Dan Sheet when we launched the Scorecard in August 2024, and the import works off of this snapshot. Any changes that you have made afterward would need to be manually copied over after importing.

### Q:  Is the scoring identical?

We use the exact same scoring logic as the Dan sheet, including modifiers and upgrades. That said, some users may see a different total on the site if there are problems with their data that weren’t caught by the sheet. Please see the details in the next answer.

### Q: What are the main differences between the Dan Sheet & Scorecard scoring?

The main source of different scoring totals is “bad” data that the Dan Sheet simply can’t account for. These exceptions are clearly identified on the site: click the (?) icon next to your point totals to view a personalized breakdown. These are the reasons a lock in your Dan Sheet may not receive points on the site:

**Missing or bad URLs**. The Dan Sheet does not check the link you provide, not even that it is a valid URL. We do basic checks, though we obviously don’t evaluate the content of your links. These are easy to fix: just click on the lock to edit and add/fix the missing/bad link.

**Upgrades**. This is probably the biggest source of legitimately different points. We have a lock upgrade system, where locks with fewer elements, more mastered pins and such are upgraded by locks with more elements, etc. To date, it hasn’t been very clear which locks upgrade others, and the burden has been on black belt pickers to figure it out and use the “upgraded” modifier in their Google sheet so that only the points for the upgraded lock count. We now have a single source for upgrade data: click on [Upgrades list](https://lpubelts.com/#/profile/scorecard/upgrades) towards the top of your scorecard, just below your dan point total, to see it. It is automatically applied consistently to everyone. This is the first time anyone has attempted to pull together a concrete list, if you disagree with a particular upgrade pair, then please raise the issue with #lock-classification for further review.

**Duplicates**. Some locks are samelined into the same entry, and therefore only one will count for dan points. The Google dan sheet also did an accurate job of calculating this, so this should not result in different points. But it is called out here, to help explain how the math works.

**Could not match**. While the importer does a really good job overall, the lock classification that the dan sheets use is slightly different from the one in lpubelts.com. You may have a lock from your dan sheet that is too ambiguous to match clearly to the right entry in lpubelts.com. No worries, you just need to find that lock in lpubelts.com and add your video link and date manually. Other times the lock may not yet exist in lpubelts.com, because it has not yet been classified. Though this will never be the cause of a point difference, since such locks weren’t worth points there either.

### Q: Will I lose my Dan Level if the LPUbelts points total falls below the one I was already awarded?

No. Dan Levels are not revoked once they are approved unless major issues are discovered, just like Belt requests. There is no change here from how the Dan Sheet works.

### Q: Can I see how I rank against other Black Belts?

Yes! We’ve built several new features to allow for just that. The **[Black Belt Leaderboard](https://lpubelts.com/#/leaderboard/blackBelts)** lets you see how you fare with other Black Belts who are using the Scorecard. **[Compare Mode](https://lpubelts.com/#/leaderboard/blackBelts?compare=true)** allows you to match any two pickers against each other, just hit the blue button to play. Please note that you can opt out of the leaderboard and still use Scorecard, just reach out to the LPUbelts team.

### Q: Can people who aren’t yet Black Belts use the Scorecard?

Sure! Any lock, even one that is not eligible for Dan Points, can be added by anyone who wants to keep track. The Scorecard will make the transition to Black Belt even easier for these people since their Dan-eligible locks will already be cataloged.

### Q: Why did you build it?

LPUbelts was originally built to directly address community needs, and we are always looking for ways to improve the LPU and lockpicking experience. The initial site (launched in Feb. 2022) was built to replace a static spreadsheet that was previously used to keep track of the Belt Ranking list. We had great success in migrating this static spreadsheet to a dynamic site, so that now LPUbelts has become the central source of a ton of lock information.

The success with the Belt Ranking list led us to look at other parts of the core picking experience to see what we could improve. We saw the Dan Sheet as an obvious area where there are a number of rough edges and errors, as well as a bunch of manual work needed to maintain it. Overall, we have made scoring locks and projects more intuitive to manage, more accurate, less prone to errors as locks are reclassified, more secure, and easier to maintain. In building towards a vision where core picking activities are integrated in one place, the Dan System is now also available on lpubelts.com.

### Q: The Dan Sheet has been around for a while, why change it?

As Black Belts ourselves, we’re very familiar with the Dan Sheet. It’s strengths and weaknesses. We aimed to build on the former and improve on the latter as we designed and built Scorecard. In our research, we identified a number of opportunities for improvement.

- **Managing large sheets is hard**. Even at lower Dans, the sheet can get unwieldy and unclear. Selecting a new lock from a lengthy pulldown of all 854 ranked locks is awkward at best and prone to error. We have introduced filters, sorting, search, and notes to help people manage large lists of locks. You can use the existing LPUbelts functionality to easily find new locks that you have picked.

- **Sheets break over time**. All it takes is a single cell to go out of date, perhaps because a lock was reclassified, and the sheet formulas cascade and break. In LPUbelts we avoid many of these problems, and even in the extreme case of certain reclassifications where a lock no longer has a place, this will never invalidate your entire Scorecard.

- **A redundant classification system**. The Dan Sheet works off of a separate classification tab that attempts to stay in sync with classification changes. This is imperfect, and we solve it in LPUbelts by using the exact same lock catalog that the full site team manages. There is no manual work needed to keep in sync, making for easier and more reliable management & updates.

- **Calculation errors and inconsistencies**. Due to human error, copying over sheet formulas, and the manual reporting of upgraded locks, there are many errors and inconsistencies in how the points are calculated in the Dan Sheet. In LPUbelts, we automatically calculate upgrades based on the hierarchy that the classification team approves. All changes are transparently applied in the same way to everyone.

- **Security and privacy concerns**. The Dan Sheet makes everyone’s Google account information available to anyone who can edit it. Additionally, any Black Belt can unintentionally edit sheets belonging to other pickers. On LPUbelts we use the same google account, but prevent any account information from becoming visible. Only the specific information you input about your locks and projects is visible to others. And only you can modify your own lock information.

- **Poor visibility into achievements**. On the Dan Sheet it is hard to share your videos with others, but on LPUbelts we have built leaderboards and tools to make it easy to share your accomplishments.

### Q. Can I keep using the Dan Sheet?

Yes. We hope Scorecard will become the official successor to the Dan Sheet but for now both systems are active and can be used for tracking your picks and projects. Worth noting: because the Dan Sheet cannot be actively connected to LPUbelts, changes in one place are not reflected in the other. It’s best to choose one or the other though of course you can keep both up-to-date.

### Q: What if I don’t want to use lpubelts.com anymore, what happens to my data?

The data is yours. You can export it at any time in a variety of formats (use the download button at the bottom of the page). You can also delete all of your data from LPUbelts by visiting the [Edit Profile](https://lpubelts.com/#/profile/edit) page.

### Q: Is the Scorecard secure?

Yes. The site was built with the latest technology and all interactions are encrypted. The Google account you use to log in to the site is never displayed and no other personal details are available to us from Google. Logging we do to monitor the site is never connected to any of your personal data.

### Q: Will LPUbelts sell my data or otherwise profit from it?

**Absolutely not.** LPUbelts was created by folks from the lockpicking community, for the lockpicking community. You can find the details in our Privacy Policy: https://lpubelts.com/#/privacy

### Q: What are the plans for Scorecard in the future?

**Community happiness.** We built Scorecard to be both useful and enjoyable. It’s our hope that Scorecard will become the official successor to the Dan Sheet in the near future. In the meantime, we’re constantly working to make it even better. We’ve just launched a Black Belt Leaderboard and Compare Mode that lets you match up any two pickers. Our top priority is to get feedback from the community to improve LPUbelts so that it is something that everyone finds useful, safe and fun.

### You still haven’t answered my question!
