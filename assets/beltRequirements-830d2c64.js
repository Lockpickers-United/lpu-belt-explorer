const e=`This is the beginning of your journey of self-discovery that will test the limits of your mind, body, and spirit. Your belt is white because you are like freshly fallen snow, pure, true of heart and ready to be molded into a lockpicking machine.

1.  Pick one of the locks ranked as yellow belt or similar
`,t=`Those security pins designed to keep you out are powerless against you. You're starting to find locks containing them easier to pick than those without.

Photographs will also be accepted for locks that cannot be disassembled.

**Requirements**

1.  Pick one of the locks ranked as orange belt or similar

your development as a lock surgeon, gutting them and getting them back
together again.

You must **video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take**,

disassembled.
