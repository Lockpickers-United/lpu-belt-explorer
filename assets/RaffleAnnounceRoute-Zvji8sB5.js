Studies indicate it has notable benefits to mental health, outward attractiveness, abstract reasoning, float picking, sleep quality, and annual income. Side effects may include societal improvements, community engagement, falling deeper and deeper into this time sink of a hobby, and abnormal dreams.

It's time for the 6th annual Lockpicking Charity Raffle! Over the course of the previous 5 raffles, the lockpicking community has raised **over $175,000** for a broad range of charities supporting causes around the globe!

Of course, a large part of this is the prize pool--the carrots which drive these donations to untold heights by enticing seasoned and aspiring lockpickers alike. As always, this prize pool is entirely donated by the community. They can come from anywhere, they can be anything (within reason), and they can go to anyone who throws their tickets in the right pot (depending on shipping preferences). Everything from locks, lock picks, lock books, lock pillows, spaghetti, dental care, bath water, back rubs, and Disneyland vacations can and have been submitted as prizes.

**If you would like to contribute prizes to this year's raffle, please contct CorrectJeans on the LPU Discord with the following information:**

1. What would you like to contribute?
2. What country are you in?
3. Are you willing to pay for domestic shipping?
4. Are you willing to ship internationally, and if so, are you willing to pay for international shipping (or do you have a maximum cost you are willing to contribute towards shipping)?
5. Is your contribution intended for one pot or multiple pots?
6. Pictures of your contribution are optional but appreciated

----

**Prizes will remain at their point of origin until the end of the raffle, at which point each contributor will be paired with the winner of their prize. Consolidation of prizes to save on shipping costs and enable wider distribution is encouraged, but not required.**

Contributors will be given a Discord role that grants access to a raffle contributors channel, where people can show off their stuff and organize prize consolidation where appropriate.

Your shipping preferences and country of origin will be used to help group prize pots together, and that information will be labelled publicly on the prize pots. This is a necessity for running an international event like this, as it allows the prizes to remain distributed across the world, and allows people to choose where to put their tickets with full knowledge of what shipping costs they might incur if they win a given prize.

**The prize contribution portion of the raffle will run from 12/01/2024 to 12/26/2024**, and the donation phase will occur during the following month, starting on January 1. That little gap is necessary because otherwise this all turns into a giant last-minute mess.

Contributions will be distributed into a collection of prize pots. Starting in January, people can enter the raffle by providing proof of donation to one of a list of approved charities (additions welcome). Their donation will be converted into tickets which can be entered freely among the prize pots.

If you have any questions about any part of the prize contribution process, how the raffle will be run this year, or want examples of previous prizes, feel free to reach out to CorrectJeans on Reddit or Discord.

Big shoutout to mgsecure, NiXXeD, and tonysansan (creators of lpubelts.com) for helping build a new home base for the raffle this year!
