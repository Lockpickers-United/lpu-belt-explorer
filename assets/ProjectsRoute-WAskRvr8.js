Master's Projects -- also known as Epic Quests -- are an integral part of Black Belt requirements and Dan System advancement. They give Black Belts further levels of mastery to aspire to and achieve, to incentivize them to remain in the community and enrich it with knowledge, and to increase the scope of what is possible within picking and locksport in general.

Earning Dan Points can be accomplished completing projects within the following Disciplines.

- Case Making
- Challenge Locks
- Community Involvement
- Cutaway Making
- Disc Detainer Pick Making
- Impressioning
- Lock Design
- Lock Manufacturing
- Pick Making
- Picking Instruction
- Safe Lock Manipulation
- Tool Making
- Tool Manufacturing
- Other Approved Projects

You can also nominate others to receive points through:
- Exceptional Knowledge of Locks
- Community Leadership
- Lock Distribution

Completed projects will be submitted for a vote in the Black Belt community in “The Mat” Discord channel to place them within the tier structure for that discipline. The generic tier point structure is below. Some Disciplines may have fewer tiers and/or less point value based on their relative difficulty.
