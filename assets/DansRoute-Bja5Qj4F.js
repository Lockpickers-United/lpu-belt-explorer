**The three-fold purpose of the Dan system is to:**

- Give Black Belts further levels of mastery to aspire to and achieve.
- To incentivize Black Belts to remain in the community and enrich it with knowledge.
- To increase the scope of what is possible within picking and locksport in general.

## Overview

You must earn Black Belt using the belt system to participate in the Dan System. (Wearing the belt in the LPU discord or /r/lockpicking subreddit is not a requirement to participate.)

It is not required that black belts participate. The “Black Belt” role will be used for those that do-not wish to participate in the Dan system. All new participants join on 1st Dan and will be rewarded with Dan Points for achievements within Locksport across two realms: Picking and Disciplines.

Total accumulated points will earn Dan Levels based on a point scale. Additionally, progression into each higher Dan Level will be limited by total number of black belt locks picked. Dan levels will be granted by the LPU moderation team upon request. (requirements must be met)

Stripes are earned through the acquisition of points.

- When an individual achieves black belt, all of their previous achievements are applied towards their total point
  value.
- A persons should never lose a belt despite point total decreases that may come about through re-categorising locks.

## Milestones

## Earning points by picking locks

Continuing to attack high-security locks is critical to advancing. This is not simply limited to the black belt list, as
many of the locks in the lower ranks are sufficiently unique that the process of picking them remains a learning
experience. For this reason, points can be earned by picking lower rank locks in addition to black belt locks.
Additionally, due to the wide range of difficulties within the list of black belt locks, they have been split into 5
levels.
For all locks, the same rules for picking on video apply.

Picking locks of blue belt or above will earn the following Dan Points

| Belt    | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Blue    | 1      |
| Purple  | 3      |
| Brown   | 6      |
| Red     | 10     |
| Black 1 | 18     |
| Black 2 | 24     |
| Black 3 | 30     |
| Black 4 | 36     |
| Black 5 | 50     |

Locks that are upgrades of each other will be awarded points only for the highest ranked lock. For example, if someone has picked both a MIWA PR with 11 unmastered elements and one with 7, then only points for the 11 will be awarded.

**[Click here for the list of official upgrades](https://lpubelts.com/#/profile/scorecard/upgrades)**.

Locks that are the same lock or only arbitrarily different will be placed on the same line, and you may only gain points for one of them. (e.g. 3KS/4KS)

## Master's Projects and The Mat

The mat is a core part of the new Dan 2.0 system. It is used for collecting community judgment on Master's Project submissions, which gain non-lockpicking
points, and are included in most new Black Belt applications.

Earning Dan Points “on the mat” can also be accomplished completing projects within the following Disciplines.

- Case Making
- Challenge Locks
- Community Involvement
- Cutaway Making
- Disc Detainer Pick Making
- Impressioning
- Lock Design
- Lock Manufacturing
- Pick Making
- Picking Instruction
- Safe Lock Manipulation
- Tool Making
- Tool Manufacturing
- Other Approved Projects

You can also nominate others to receive points through:
- Exceptional Knowledge of Locks
- Community Leadership
- Lock Distribution

Completed projects will be submitted for a vote in the black belt community in “The Mat” channel to place them within
the tier structure for that discipline. The generic tier point structure is below. Some Disciplines may have fewer tiers
and/or less point value based on their relative difficulty.

| Tier   | Points | Desc       |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Tier 0 | 0      | Unworthy   |
| Tier 1 | 5      | Novice     |
| Tier 2 | 10     | Apprentice |
| Tier 3 | 20     | Journeyman |
| Tier 4 | 34     | Expert     |
| Tier 5 | 50     | Mastery    |

To submit completed projects for placement in the respective Discipline Tier:

- Assemble any relevant information, pictures, video links, etc. in PDF format and submit to a moderator to be shared with
the black belt community in “The Mat” channel.
- That moderator will place it in the channel along with an @Black Belt mention as soon as possible so long as there
aren’t already several votes taking place.
- If you hate being pinged, change your settings. This is necessary to ensure each project is seen.
- All Black Belt members will have 5 days from post time to vote using number emojis 0 through 5. If two or more Tiers are
tied, the vote will round up to the highest Tier.
- After 5 days a moderator will close out the vote by posting the result of the vote and confirming the point value of
that project.
- The submitter can then use that point value and date/time to enter the project into their tab of the Dan Sheet. You
should also add a link to that post to make it easier for fact-checkers.

Those who emote anything other than a number to represent a Tier will forfeit their vote. Repeated offenses will result
in suspension of access to the channel.

## Point Modifiers

There are special cases in which the Dan Point value for a lock is modified to reflect the amount of work and skill that was required to open it. Achievements below apply a multipler to the normal Dan points for the lock as ranked.

A **Public First** is defined as the first public video (or other evidence) of picking/defeating a specific ranked lock. Multiplier will be applied even if the open was documented before the classification of the lock. Please note that picking/defeating very similar locks, or identical locks under different brands, should not be considered a public first.

**Notable opens** are generally awarded for locks that have stood unpicked or undefeated for some time despite the community's efforts to attack them. Notable locks may also include new models with a distinctly novel locking mechanism. Minor changes in pin count, etc. do not qualify.  Submissions of "Notable" firsts must be approved by the Mod team.

The following modifiers are recognized:

**First Recorded Pick** - 1.5x Dan Points, 2.5x for Notable Locks
- The first public video (or other evidence) of picking a specific ranked lock.

**First Recorded Defeat** - 1.5x Dan Points, 2x for Notable Locks
- Demonstrating and documenting a non-picking method of defeating a lock which has no known prior defeats. Defeat must be performed non-destructively.

**Novel Non-Picking Defeat** - 0.75x Dan Points
- This includes locks which have existing known defeat methods as long as the new approach is materially different from existing ones. Note that this modifier can only be applied once to a specific lock by the picker, no matter how many new approaches they discover.

## Dan Sheet 2.0 & Scorecard

Both Scorecard and Dan Sheets can be used to request Dan Levels. The two systems are **not** linked, so we recommend choosing one or the other to keep current. Alternately, you may choose to update both.

Scorecard

- Scorecard entries can be added at any time.
- You must be already be approved for Black Belt through the normal request process.
- Create an account & set Display Name on lpubelts.com if you don't have one.
- Contact the LPUbelts team directly or in #belt-explorer to have your belt approval entered into the system.
- For more info, [click here](https://lpubelts.com/#/profile/scorecard/howto).

Dan Sheet

- Dan Sheet add/edit permissions are gated by Google e-mail accounts sent to the mods.

Overall

- Dan requests continue to be made through #belt-requests. Please include a link to your Scorecard *or* Dan Sheet, not both.
- Each member will be responsible for filling out their own locks & projects to participate.
- Prior users must check/update their entries to make sure they are scored appropriately.
- New point values will apply to everyone participating in Dan 2.0

- Grandfathered black belt points are no longer valid.
- Each Picking entry requires:
    - an active link to the video.
    - the point modifier (if applicable)
- Each Discipline entry requires:
    - a date/time of the mod confirmation of Tier rank from “The Mat” Channel.
    - No unsubstantiated entries or entries with disqualified videos will count for Dan Points.
- New Dan Levels will be assigned upon completion if required.
- You cannot lose your Dan level due to belt ranking changes however, Dan sheet tabs that are not up-to-date with current lock rankings are not eligible for review or upgrade to the next level.
- Review is only done upon request through the lpu belt bot

There are a few special conditions:

- **Reference documents**: Creating a formal reference document which breaks down all the main points of a locks design,
  operation, and vulnerabilities (assuming no document already exists for it)
