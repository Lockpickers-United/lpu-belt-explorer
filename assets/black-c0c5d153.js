const e=`This is the beginning of your journey of self-discovery that will test the limits of your mind, body, and spirit. Your belt is white because you are like freshly fallen snow, pure, true of heart and ready to be molded into a lockpicking machine.

Both photos and videos of your picking accomplishment are accepted for this rank.

**Requirements**

- Pick any lock with any tool.

**Evidence format**

- Photos or vídeos, showing turned core.
`,n=`You understand the basic function of locks, and technique to pick them. Normal padlocks crumble at your very glance and you've moved onto higher quality cylinders, some of which may even contain security pins.

Both photos and videos of your picking accomplishment are accepted for this rank.

**Requirements**

- Pick one of the locks ranked as yellow belt.

**Evidence format**

- Photos or vídeos, showing turned core.
`,t=`Those security pins designed to keep you out are powerless against you. You're starting to find locks containing them easier to pick than those without. Your family is also starting to look at you and your growing collection of locks a bit strangely. It's OK -- we understand you. Let's get an orange belt on you to confuse them further.

**Requirements**

- Pick one of the locks ranked as orange belt.

**Evidence format**

- You must submit a **video** of your picking accomplishments for this rank. Videos must be in one continuous take.
- Photographs showing turned core will also be accepted for locks that cannot be disassembled.
`,o=`Higher quality locks with even more security pins. Some of these locks have
dead cores, and it's not just because you've picked them to death. It might
also be that you have started down the dimple lock road. You've also started
your development as a lock surgeon, gutting them and getting them back
together again.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP (single pin pick) one of the locks ranked as green belt

**Non-Picking Requirements**

- Demonstrate your ability to gut locks.
- Demonstrate your ability to reassemble locks (the reassembly can be a different lock and even in a separate video).

**Evidence format**

- You must **video** picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take, **pictures are no longer accepted at this rank**, even for locks that cannot be disassembled.
- For locks that cannot be gutted -- e.g. Master Lock #410 LOTO -- video documentation of gutting and reassembling a different lock will be accepted.
- Reassembly can be a different lock and even in a separate video

Check out the KOD [guide to making pick and gut videos](https://youtu.be/gcekRz-7If8) if you not familiar with the
process. Remember, [vertical video hurts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dechvhb0Meo).
`,i=`Transitionary phase in your mastery. You are leaving the relative calm and predictable world of standard locks behind and dipping a toe into the strange and bizarre world of high-security locks. You are frequently pinning your own locks, doing advanced projects, and helping newer members of the lockpicking community as they progress.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP and gut one of the locks ranked as Blue Belt.

- *Note:* If picking an SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core), be sure to review the guidelines listed under SFIC Filming Requirements for validating your lock in the picking video. Please see/click below for the "SFIC Filming Requirements" section with detailed information.

**Picking Evidence Format**

- Pick and gut in a continuous video take without cuts, keeping the lock and components in frame.

**Blue Belt Project Requirements** (Updated February 2025)

To qualify for a Blue Belt, you must also submit a project that demonstrates your growing knowledge of locks and lockpicking. **We encourage new and creative approaches to these projects**. You can choose from a variety of options, please see/click below for the "Blue Belt Project Requirements" section with more detailed information. Accepted projects include:

`,s=`You are entering the realm of ultra high-security locks and becoming a
pillar of the lockpicking community. You find yourself picking locks that

`,l=`Zen music plays when you enter the room. You wake up from dreams in which you are trying to figure out ways to pick the
unpickable. You have mentored two or more pickers at the brown and red belt levels, and you have published the specs to
at least one custom tool of your own design.

To earn a black belt, world-class picking is necessary but not sufficient. Mentoring others is necessary but not
sufficient. You must deviate from your comfort zone and complete at least two epic quests of sufficient complexity and
difficulty. Black Belt Pickers are extremely rare, and while this system was designed with a degree of levity, earning
one is true honor and something to be very, very proud of.

You must video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take, If there is a sidebar it must also be
displayed to show nothing has been tampered with. There are no exceptions to the gutting requirement for videos of black
belt locks.

In gutting, all components relevant to function must be shown clearly and zoomed in. This varies by lock and it is
recommended applicants ask in the discord or via modmail prior to filming. All locks must be gutted, even if destruction
is required to gut.
