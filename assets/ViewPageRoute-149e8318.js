**Iâ€™m writing in to have Picking Time considered as one of my Epic Quests toward my black belt.**

Picking Time was created to bring together the community in a way that hasnâ€™t been done before. Some of us donâ€™t live near or have any access to the TOOOL meetings and so I wanted to create something that everyone could be a part of no matter where they lived. It all stemmed from me wanting to pick with someone else, as I was feeling quite alone picking at home and not able to actually pick with anyone else. So with the help of LockHeat Lockpicking, Picking Time was born.

We do a weekly meetup of locksporters, where we exchange ideas, help one another, promote each otherâ€™s projects and channels, cheer each other on, we do locksport related giveaways and most importantly we help keep people involved and interested in locksport and the locksport community.

Our giveaways are mostly items that are donated by lock pick manufacturers or other locksporters ie. custom picks, plaques, signs, pins, etc. I also try to keep it in the community by purchasing items made by other locksporters when we donâ€™t have donated items to give away.

I search around on FB and Reddit for newer pickers and gift them with some of the locks donated to Picking Time for this purpose. This helps bring them into the Picking Time community as I invite those people to join us and I have had people actually join in this way. This is part of what Picking Time is about. I do this to try to help the newer pickers feel like they are a part of our community, try to help keep them interested in picking and offer them any help they would need also.

We may not have a strict schedule of events for each meet up, but we let it flow depending on what people need or want to see or have questions about that week and we aim the subject of the shows toward that. We have a couple black belt seasoned locksporters that join each week and they offer advice and lessons on certain locks. Sometimes we run over 3 hours and could actually go longer bc people really love that they are able to pick with each other this way.


LockHeat and I have even created a discord channel for Picking Time where we have over 40 members. This was done so that the people who are on Picking Time donâ€™t have to wait a week to talk with the others if they have questions or want to show off something theyâ€™ve accomplished. They can converse with or seek help from one another any time they need to. We have a help tab where a couple of our black belt members specifically offer help.

All locksporters can join us on camera and pick with us or they can just pick with us at home while they join in the chat. They get to know each other and become more involved each week.

Weâ€™ve been going for 27 weeks and our participants are only growing.  I feel like this shows that the pickers that cannot attend official meet ups or are just feeling alone, can now feel included in the community in a different way.

In addition to this, Picking Time offers our Stream Yard to any one of our community to use to go live or create their own shows with. We also offer the entire show to be hosted by anyone who would like to host. Knox Locks just hosted a show for his birthday, qnd there are 2 locksporters working on putting out a show utilizing the Picking Time stream yard. And Greenish and I are doing an 'Impressioning Time' show as an offshoot of Picking Time, where we show our journey together while he teaches me impressioning. We offer any of this anytime to anyone in the community.

I believe this qualifies as a tier 2 or 3 quest as it checks these items on the list:

A promotion and organization continuously maintained of a subtype of picking activity through the creation of a group that benefits the community as a whole or a subset of pickers interested in this picking related activity.

A promotion of locksport through live presentations.

A creation and maintenance of an informative locksport related channel.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

`,T=`Attention all lockpicking enthusiasts, tinkerers, and masters of the craft! We are thrilled to unveil a bold new tradition in our ranking systemâ€”from this day forward, all lockpicking belts will be shades of pink! ðŸŽ€âœ¨

Why pink? Because mastery isnâ€™t about intimidationâ€”itâ€™s about skill, precision, and finesse. The Pink Belt System honors the legacy of those who challenge expectations, proving that true expertise isnâ€™t judged by color, but by technique. Whether youâ€™re a beginner with your first set of picks or a seasoned locksmith unraveling the most devious mechanisms, your belt will be a badge of both skill and style.

From Baby Pink Novice to Fuscia Grandmaster, each rank will now carry a distinct shade, making every stage of the journey as visually striking as it is technically challenging.

So sharpen your skills, embrace the pink, and letâ€™s redefine what it means to be a master of locks. **The future is unlockedâ€”and itâ€™s pink!** ðŸ”‘ðŸ’–

*Please note: we are in the process of converting everything to the new belt colors. Please be patient if we haven't gotten to everything just yet.*`,P=`The Lockpickers United ranking process may seem opaque but it isn't a secret. It's a big job done by the community and it powers the nearly 900 locks currently on the site, more than 750 of which are ranked.

There is a community classification database in which Black Belts and advanced pickers (basically people with the knowledge, skill, and experience required to classify locks) enter their ranking for a particular lock. This applies to new locks as well as existing ones where a change in ranking is being considered.

New locks can be officially added by the classification team and are usually included because something is new, interesting, or there is a new batch of locks that multiple people can get their hands on. Anyone can now submit a lock for consideration by using the **[Ranking Request form](https://lpubelts.com/#/content/lockrequest)**.

Locks can only be actively reviewed if they are available/can be sent to members of the classification team for testing. Locks are more likely to be considered if photos and information are available. It's worth mentioning that Yellow & Orange locks are not added frequently because there are so many of them already on the site and it's impossible to keep up with the huge number of easier locks available.

The team ranks locks (not anonymously) with the goal of getting consensus from at least three advanced pickers. Once enough votes have been cast to get consensus, mods and staff hold a yes/no vote to approve the new lock/ranking change.

Approved additions & changes are compiled into a #changelog that is released every few months (though it has been more frequent lately). Those changes are then implemented on lpubelts.com and copied over to the belt ranking page on reddit.

Unranked locks are added to lpubelts.com in a loose process that focuses on locks with multiple rankings that seem headed to the site, locks of unusual interest, and sometimes just locks for which we receive/take a good batch of photos. Anything that is actively being ranked gets flagged with the "Under Review" feature on the site.
