>Another list from the LPUbelts team. Here’s a slightly different take than the path I actually took, focusing on [dimple locks](/#/locks?tab=search&lockingMechanisms=Dimple). I did use them from Purple to Black and they are a fascinating and challenging switch from “traditional” pin-tumbler locks.

>(Some more notes here about non-ranked locks) 

- 7ec79663
- Kenaurd is a house brand at UHS Hardware and this lock doesn’t contain spooled or serrated outer pins. Their 1” mortice lock has four pins while 1 1/8” and longer come with five. Pin-in-Pin "sounds" scary' at first but they’re really not that much harder than standard pins.
- I use the Multipick #7 and small #10 which were designed for PIP locks but a standard flag works well too. The [ABUS D6](/#/locks?id=f97700ff&name=ABUS_D6) seems like a popular option in the UK.  (I actually submitted the pin-tumbler [ABUS 72/40](/#/locks?id=74a00ae3&name=ABUS_72_40).)

- b91162e7
- Another house brand from UHS, though any [HQ High Security Interactive clone](/#/locks?id=c1d09460&name=Any_HQ_High_Security_Interactive_clone) will do. This is a step up from the Kenaurd in that it contains PIP spooled security pins. I generally prefer security pins for the feedback they give and this lock has decently deep spools. Again with the MP #7 and 10. You could also go with a four pin [Mul-T-Lock Classic/Interactive](/#/locks?id=aec0c82d&name=MulTLock_Classic) or an [ ABUS 75/50](/#/locks?id=9ec8706c&name=ABUS_75_50) padlock for Blue. (I actually submitted the [American Lock 1100](/#/locks?id=2ae1e0b8&name=American_Lock_1100___A1100) which used to be Blue.)

- Starting at Purple, you need to submit **two** different locks for each belt. My second one was the [**DeGuard Interactive clone**](/#/locks?id=db4de1bb). They are similar, five pin-in-pin stack locks. The MTL locks definitely have tighter tolerances and the Junior is a good introduction to them. There are a lot of other [Purple Belt dimple locks](/#/locks?tab=Purple&lockingMechanisms=Dimple) if these aren't available in your area.

- 7194cc26
- And the [**Mul-T-Lock Interactive**](/#/locks?id=5c5701d7&name=MulTLock_Classic) (serrated driver pins). MTL locks are tougher with serrated drivers but not dramatically harder. The Japanese GOAL D9 however, is a real big shift in approach and difficulty. This cute little lock has three rows of pins with three pins each and is a great introduction to so-called "High Pin Count" (HPC) locks. Progressive pinning is a really great way to learn these, I start with the pins in the back and add in groups of three. Trying with just one full row is also a good way to get a feel for things. The [WEST 916](/#/locks?id=18e1f45b&name=WEST_916) is another good Brown Belt HPC lock. It has two rows of six pins each on both sides.

- eed91da5
- And [**ABUS EC700/EC800**](/#/locks?id=b29a8b44&name=ABUS_EC700). The MIWA JN has four rows of pins, two on the sides and two coming in diagonally from the bottom. It is capable of having up to 21 pins but counts for Red with 14. It's similar to other HPC locks like the [GOAL v18](/#/locks?id=9f613c4a) but doesn't have over-milling in the core. I use the same curved flag approach here.

- 109531f4
- And the [**WEST 917**](/#/locks?id=23437955&name=WEST_917). The V18 is a beast of a lock with three rows of pins and up to 19 active pin stacks. It has over-milling in the core that creates overset traps if you aren't careful. It is Black Belt with 14-16 pins and BB2 with all 19. Under some peer pressure, I picked it with 19 :-) Patience is key and progressive pinning really helped me tackle it. I can't keep track of all 19 pins at once, so I broke it down into zones like "back left" and "front right" to help me picture it.

>This is the beginning of what we plan to be a series of posts sharing a "Path to Black" from an experienced picker. Here's one approach I put together that only uses traditional pin-tumbler locks, the first of a few lists by folks on the LPUbelts team.

- This is a great padlock to practice with early on. It's repinnable, so you can buy security pins and practice just like the Sparrows practice locks, except this one has real lock feedback. Default pinning is going to be light serrated in stack 1 and the rest spools. After you're bored with the core, you can swap any standard KIK into this and pick in hand!

- 2ae1e0b8
- The classic. This comes highly recommended for good reason. Great tension and jiggle test practice to warm you up for blue.

- 331c9d36
- Australian classic. Five thin lipped spools for a really fun pick. This should help round out your tension practice for purple!

- 45e3cde7
- Barrels are rough, but without a sidebar this is doable! Progressive pin will be your friend here and up, and you'll see why barrels are so effective at 3-4+ stacks.

- a1233156
- Fun spools and gins to start to really challenge you. Not many PTs make it to this belt level without a secondary locking mechanism. This will warm you up for red.

- 937eb7a8
- A red belted Goal Z is just one pin from a Black lock! Amazing tolerances, different shaped spools, and gins with matching milling. Round that off with overmilling as well for a big challenge. You likely can get an extra pin to make this black as well!

- f133510b
- The classic PT Black experience. Shoot for the ideal pinning if possible, should be tapers in 3/5/7, with 2+ trees and rest gins. If you can get it grubbed, do it! It makes the gutting/PP experience much safer and basically unbrickable.`,p={nixxed:{content:N,title:"NiXXeD",description:"A classic pin-tumbler path to black"},mgsecure:{content:W,title:"mgsecure",description:"A path to black comprising all dimple locks"}};function G(){const r=y(),f=T(),{pageId:c}=B.parse(f.search),u={maxWidth:700,marginLeft:"auto",marginRight:"auto",padding:"6px 20px",borderRadius:0};return e.jsxs("div",{style:{margin:8,paddingBottom:32,marginLeft:"auto",marginRight:"auto",marginTop:16,marginBottom:16},children:[!p[c]&&e.jsxs(l.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx("div",{style:{...u,fontSize:"1.8rem",fontWeight:700,padding:"8px 0 0 18px"},children:"Path to Black"}),e.jsxs("div",{style:u,children:[`We've asked advanced pickers to share their view of a "Path to Black", tracing the steps of rising through the LPU Belt Rankings.
