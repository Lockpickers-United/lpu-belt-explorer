### Introduction to the Belt Ranking System

The Belt Ranking system is a tiered classification developed and maintained by LockPickers United (LPU), a group of locksport experts and enthusiasts. It emulates the color-coded belt rankings commonly used in martial arts disciplines and functions primarily to codify achievements in lockpicking and related skills. The rankings attempt to provide a concrete framework for quantifying skill and progress in lockpicking/locksport.

Belt rankings are defined by lists of qualifying locks, forms of documentation for picking, and other related challenges for more advanced belts. Participants submit documentation of their accomplishments for review by moderators and are awarded belt ranks accordingly.

The belt ranking system is used both as a means of comparing the relative difficulty of locks as well as a set of milestones for evaluating one's personal progress and achievements. It creates a basic model of reputation management for participants and other people involved in locksport. An individual's belt rank is also used by LPU to limit access to some resources on sensitive topics such as safecracking.

Belt ranking classification is also used as a shorthand for lock difficulty, as each belt defines a list of locks of comparable complexity. Locks not on the list are frequently described by their "approximate" belt level.

Today, there are nearly 800 locks ranked in the system.

### The LPU Belt Explorer

Launched in February 2023, the LPU Belt Explorer is an interactive tool that allows users to explore and learn about the locks within the system. It provides detailed information on a wide array of locks, supported by nearly 3,000 photos contributed by over 200 authors, covering approximately 95% of all ranked locks. This resource has become invaluable for both new and experienced members of the locksport community.

Key features and purposes of the LPU Belt Explorer include:

**Comprehensive Database**: The Belt Explorer serves as a detailed repository of locks that are part of the LPU ranking system. This includes nearly 800 locks, each with specific characteristics and challenges associated with different belt levels.

**In-depth Information**: For each lock listed, the Belt Explorer provides detailed information. This includes aspects such as the lock's design, difficulty level, key features, photos, and select videos.

**Extensive Visual Resources**: The tool boasts nearly 3,000 photographs, contributed by over 200 authors, which cover nearly 95% of all ranked locks. This visual aid enhances the learning experience, offering users a real-world view of various locks and their mechanisms.

**Educational and Collaborative**: By providing a centralized platform for detailed lock information, the Belt Explorer serves both educational and collaborative purposes. It helps members of the locksport community to better understand the locks they are working with and facilitates knowledge sharing.

**Integration with the Belt Ranking System**: The Explorer is directly linked to the LPU Belt Ranking System, making it a valuable resource for those seeking to progress through the belt ranks. Users can use it to identify which locks they need to learn and master to advance to the next level.

### The Origins and Development of the Belt Ranking System
The Belt System was conceived by tumbl3r in January 2017. In an interview, tumbl3r revealed the motivation behind its creation:

"I wrote it because at the time literally nobody was picking hard locks. It was just Master #3 over and over again on Reddit. I did it as a way to show people that more interesting things existed... I could have never anticipated what it would become. It's nice that it has brought people joy and hopefully enhanced the experience. When we first published it, a lot of people said it was stupid."

Tumbl3r emphasized the system's collaborative nature: "I always thought it was important for it to not be a competition, but rather a self-sustaining way of being inspired by and helping people. That's why at the higher levels you are actually required to help others."

Tumbl3r highlighted the key aspects of the LPU Belt Ranking System and its development:

**Promoting Lock Diversity**: The primary goal was to showcase the variety and complexity of locks available, encouraging enthusiasts to engage with more challenging and interesting locks.

**Fostering Collaboration**: The system was designed to emphasize collaboration over competition. It aimed to cultivate cooperative relationships within the community, where members help and inspire each other.

**Challenges of Administration**: Managing belt requests has consistently been a demanding task, often handled by the newest moderators. This work is crucial yet taxing, and the efforts of these moderators are greatly appreciated.

**Overcoming Initial Skepticism**: Initially, the system faced criticism, with some dismissing it as mere "Internet Points." However, tumbl3r viewed this as a positive, emphasizing that it was intended to be a fun and engaging game.

**Inclusion of Challenge Locks**: While initially opposed to the idea of challenge locks, tumbl3r was persuaded to include them. Despite being controversial, they serve an important role in advancing to higher belt levels.

**Aspirations for Belt Distribution**: There was a hope for a Pareto distribution among the belts, which seemed to have been achieved, reflecting a balance in the distribution of skill levels across the community.

The system, initially a small project on Reddit, gradually expanded and evolved with contributions from various community members, including ITH, MMDeveloper, evr-, Supallama, loupgarou21, potkettleracism, and CorrectJeans (creator of the Dan System and current game master).

### The Dan System

To further motivate advanced pickers, the "Dan System" was introduced in late 2018 by CorrectJeans. It is a tiered ranking of advanced pickers that awards points for picking higher-belt locks. The Dan system provides additional challenges and goals for Black Belts to maintain their involvement in the hobby.

In an interview with LPUBelts, CorrectJeans reflected on its history:

"The initial version of the LPU Belt Ranking System was developed in just a few hours, originally intended as a preliminary trial rather than a fully-fledged system. After its creation, I invited several people to calculate their scores as a test to identify necessary adjustments. Surprisingly, the community began treating it as the official system immediately. This rapid adoption made it challenging to implement any significant changes without disrupting the community's engagement."


"As time passed, certain limitations and complexities within the system became evident. These primarily revolved around intricate rules for scoring locks and subjective guidelines concerning tool production. Both aspects were disproportionately emphasized in the system.
To address these issues, we convened a summit, led by Digs, to deliberate on potential reforms. This meeting played a crucial role in establishing the foundation for community rankings, though my recollection might be imprecise."

"The development of the 2.0 system was a collaborative effort involving several individuals, including Grav, Rein, Red Wanderer, Norlin, Iona, and Retep. I was less involved at this stage."

"Regarding the original intent of the Dan 1.0 system, it was designed to be minimally regulated. The philosophy was that those who reached this advanced stage were motivated by personal achievement and would adhere to the spirit of the system without the need for stringent oversight. This approach was feasible until the number of Black Belts increased significantly, necessitating a reassessment of the system's structure."
