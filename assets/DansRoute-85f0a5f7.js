The three-fold purpose of the Dan system is to:

Give Black Belts further levels of mastery to aspire to and achieve, to incentivize Black Belts to remain in the
community and enrich it with knowledge and to increase the scope of what is possible within picking and locksport in
general.

## Overview

You must earn Black Belt using the belt system to participate in the Dan System. (wearing the belt in the LPU discord or
/r/lockpicking subreddit is not a requirement to participate)

It is not required that black belts participate. The “Black Belt” role will be used for those that do-not wish to
participate in the Dan system.
All new participants join on 1st Dan and will be rewarded with Dan Points for achievements within Locksport across two
realms Picking and Disciplines.

Total accumulated points will earn Dan Levels based on a point scale. Additionally, progression into each higher Dan
Level will be limited by total number of black belt locks picked.
Dan levels will be granted by the LPU moderation team upon request. (requirements must be met)

Stripes are earned through the acquisition of points.

- When an individual achieves black belt, all of their previous achievements are applied towards their total point
  value.
- A persons should never lose a belt despite point total decreases that may come about through re-categorising locks.

## Milestones

## Earning points by picking locks

Continuing to attack high-security locks is critical to advancing. This is not simply limited to the black belt list, as
many of the locks in the lower ranks are sufficiently unique that the process of picking them remains a learning
experience. For this reason, points can be earned by picking lower rank locks in addition to black belt locks.
Additionally, due to the wide range of difficulties within the list of black belt locks, they have been split into 5
levels.
For all locks, the same rules for picking on video apply.

Picking locks of blue belt or above will earn the following Dan Points

| Belt    | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Blue    | 1      |
| Purple  | 3      |
| Brown   | 6      |
| Red     | 10     |
| Black 1 | 18     |
| Black 2 | 24     |
| Black 3 | 30     |
| Black 4 | 36     |
| Black 5 | 50     |

Locks that are upgrades of each other will be recorded once for the highest ranked lock. For example, if someone has picked both a MIWA PR with 11 unmastered elements as well as one with 7, then only points for the 11 will be awarded.

Locks that are the same lock or only arbitrarily different will be placed on the same line and you may only gain points
for one of them. (3KS/4KS)

Notable locks can and will be put up for a vote within “The Mat” channel.

## Master's Projects and The Mat

The mat is a core part of the new Dan 2.0 system. It is used for collecting community judgment on Master's Project submissions, which gain non-lockpicking
points, and are included in most new Black Belt applications.

Earning Dan Points “on the mat” can also be accomplished completing projects within the following Disciplines.

- Challenge Locks
- Community Involvement
- Cutaway Making
- Disc Detainer Pick Making
- Impressioning
- Lock Design
- Lock Manufacturing
- Pick Making
- Picking Instruction
- Safe Lock Manipulation
- Tool Making
- Tool Manufacturing
- Other Approved Projects

You can also nominate others to receive points through:
- Exceptional Knowledge of Locks
- Community Leadership
- Lock Distribution

Completed projects will be submitted for a vote in the black belt community in “The Mat” channel to place them within
the tier structure for that discipline. The generic tier point structure is below. Some Disciplines may have fewer tiers
and/or less point value based on their relative difficulty.

| Tier   | Points | Desc       |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Tier 0 | 0      | Unworthy   |
| Tier 1 | 5      | Novice     |
| Tier 2 | 10     | Apprentice |
| Tier 3 | 20     | Journeyman |
| Tier 4 | 34     | Expert     |
| Tier 5 | 50     | Mastery    |

To submit completed projects for placement in the respective Discipline Tier:

- Assemble any relevant information, pictures, video links, etc. in PDF format and submit to a moderator to be shared with
the black belt community in “The Mat” channel.
- That moderator will place it in the channel along with an @Black Belt mention as soon as possible so long as there
aren’t already several votes taking place.
- If you hate being pinged, change your settings. This is necessary to ensure each project is seen.
- All Black Belt members will have 5 days from post time to vote using number emoji’s 0 thru 5. If two or more Tiers are
tied, the vote will round up to the highest Tier.
- After 5 days a moderator will close out the vote by posting the result of the vote and confirming the point value of
that project.
- The submitter can then use that point value and date/time to enter the project into their tab of the Dan Sheet. You
should also add a link to that post to make it easier for fact checkers.

Those who emote anything other than a number to represent a Tier will forfeit their vote. Repeated offenses will result
in suspension of access to the channel.

## Point Modifiers

There are special cases in which the point value for a lock is modified to reflect the amount of work and skill that was
required to pick it.
- First recorded pick: In the event that an individual is the first person to pick a certain lock on video, even if done
before the classification of the lock, x1.5 points.
  - Note: This bonus is awarded at the discretion of the moderators, and does not apply if the lock in question is very
  similar to a previously picked lock.
- First recorded pick (notable lock): Certain locks on the list will be marked with a * which indicates that they are
  locks that have famously not been picked on video. Being the first to demonstrate a successful pick of a notable lock
  receives x2.5 points.
- Non-picking defeat: Demonstrating a previously unknown method of defeating a specific lock nondestructively other than
  picking receives x0.75 points.
  - Note that creating a new defeat for a lock you have already picked does result in additional points.
- Non-picking defeat (first defeat): Demonstrating a non-picking method of defeating a lock which has no known prior
  defeats receives x1.5 points (x2, notable lock), however the lock will still be considered unpicked.

## Dan Sheet 2.0

- Dan Sheet will be utilized
- Add/edit permissions will be gated by e-mail accounts
- Each Black Belt will be given their own tab within this sheet.
- Each member will be responsible for
    - filling out their own tab in the new sheet with the new point values and any further entries going forward.
- New point values will apply to everyone participating in Dan 2.0
- Grandfathered black belt points are no longer valid.
- Each Picking entry requires:
    - an active link to the video.
    - the point modifier (if applicable)
- Each Discipline entry requires:
    - a date/time of the mod confirmation of Tier rank from “The Mat” Channel.
    - No unsubstantiated entries or entries with disqualified videos will count for Dan Points.
- New Dan Levels will be assigned upon completion if required.
- You cannot lose your Dan level due to belt ranking changes however, Dan sheet tabs that are not up to date with
  current
- lock rankings are not eligible for review or upgrade to the next level.
- Review is only done upon request through the lpu belt bot

Earning points through skills and community involvement

- **Reference documents**: Creating a formal reference document which breaks down all the main points of a locks design,
  operation, and vulnerabilities (assuming no document already exists for it)

  method of picking a type of lock and publish a video or document describing how it works (must have new information).
  **+10 points**
