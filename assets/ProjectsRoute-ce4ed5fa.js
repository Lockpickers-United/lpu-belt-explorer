Master's Projects -- also known as Epic Quests -- are an integral part of Black Belt requirements and Dan System advancement. They give Black Belts further levels of mastery to aspire to and achieve, to incentivize them to remain in the community and enrich it with knowledge, and to increase the scope of what is possible within picking and locksport in general.

Completed projects will be submitted for a vote in the Black Belt community in “The Mat” Discord channel to place them within the tier structure for that discipline. The generic tier point structure is below. Some Disciplines may have fewer tiers and/or less point value based on their relative difficulty.

### Cutaway Making

- **Tier 1** - At least one good quality cutaway
- **Tier 2** - 2 good cutaways of separate locks or one of extraordinary quality. Leniency for handmade.
  - Example of a tier 2 cutaway project: [Loose_Shirt6551 BB1 Quest Cutaways](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y7PGX88xdMlEWOWhMb7oRjJ1FBs62NNrCkwEJ0bjM5Q)

### Impressioning

- **Tier 1** - Blind impressioning* of a simple wafer lock or 4 or less pins pin tumbler.
- **Tier 2** - Blind impressioning of 5 or more pins, simple pin tumbler or dimple lock.
  - Example of a tier 2 impressioning project: https://youtu.be/NWfle86S6oQ

Being provided a lock from a trusted source (e.g. a member of LPU staff or a black belt) who can vouch for it being keyless is acceptable. Unguttable padlocks are acceptable, as are other formats provided they can be made tamper proof, for example by sealing screws with wax or intentionally stripping screws to make them unremovable. 

### Pick Making

- **Tier 2** - Group 2 safe of easier type e.g. S&G 6700, Big Red CDL3. Dials with false gates, such as a 6642, also count as tier 2.
  - Example of a tier 2 safecracking project: [Group 2 Safe Manipulation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyrVUziE0umP-zhbpzN42ZpvexI-JhGwoonjgZTjyiI/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Cutaways will not be accepted.
- **Tier 3** - Group 2/2M safe of harder type e.g. 4 wheels: LaGard 1800, Chubb 7L64 or false gates and nose roller like the S&G 6630.
- **Tier 4** - Group 1 with established method - requires more than just a graphing attack.
- **Tier 5** - Opening any previously unopened combination lock with a new method.

Safe dials should have the code set by another source (does not have to be an LPU member) and the cracker should be able to describe their process and show work for how the code was determined.

### Other Master's Projects

Other projects may be evaluated for Dan points on a case by case basis.
