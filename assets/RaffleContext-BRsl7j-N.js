CollateralTech sure has! Instead of filming for Green Belt, CT has been up late laboring out of love and lunacy, trying to jam over two dozen locksport tools into a condom wrapper. The result? A nifty fifty-fifty mixture of hooks and rakes with enough tools to cover most basic pin-tumbler locks and then some. The condom wrapper idea didn't pan out, but the finished package easily fits inside an American 1100 box. Put your RAFL tickets down to win some locks, some fun swag, and an updated copy of CT's original pint-sized passion project, the Stuffed Sparrow.","descriptionContinued":"","potContents":"- Sparrows Curved Tension Wrench Pouch\\n- 3x Southern Specialties 2-pocket Vinyl Sleeves\\n- Southern Specialties prototype KGB folding pickset (6 Bogota profiles)\\n- Southern Specialties prototype KGB folding pickset (6 hook profiles)\\n- Southern Specialties Double-sided Tension Tool (nests with SP-57)\\n- Lock Picker's Bench Edition MultiPick SP-57 Tapered BOK wrench\\n- Newhouse Lock and Key Pocket Rewind (0.025, 0.020)\\n- Sparrows Rock Out Key (Octo Rake profile, inspired by DeadHammer)\\n- 3x SouthOrd Pen Picks (Half-Diamond, Low Hook, Long Snake)\\n- Sparrows Heavy Heavy bar (0.079/2mm)\\n- Southern Specialties Z-bar Tension Wrench Set (0.030, 0.040, 0.050)\\n- Southern Specialties TOK Wrench (with teeth, 0.035)\\n- Southern Specialties 2500 Series Wrench Set (0.030, 0.040, 0.050, TOK and BOK)\\n- Southern Specialties Titanium Quick Stick knife\\n- Southern Specialties Titanium EZ Decoder\\n- Southern Specialties Utility Wafer Jiggler\\n- Sparrows Mantis Tubular Lock Wrench\\n- Plastic shim for push-side bypass on internal doors","keywords":"","contributedBy":["CollateralTech"],"tags":["Picks (hooks)","Picks (rakes)","Tensioners (TOK)","Tensioners (BOK)","Tensioners (tubular)","Tensioners (other)","Cases","Tools (decoding)","Tools (bypass)","Compact","EDC","Puzzle"],"country":["USA"],"shippingInfo":"","splitShipping":"shippingSplit","splitShippingBoolean":false,"shippingType":"","shipsToUS":"","dateAdded":"","media":[{"title":"By: CollateralTech","subtitle":"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0","thumbnailUrl":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54975333272_8ee7b66a2d_w.jpg","fullUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lpubeltapp/54975333272/in/album-72177720330595608/","sequenceId":7,"fullSizeUrl":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54975333272_ff82ddb566_o.jpg"},{"title":"By: CollateralTech","subtitle":"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0","thumbnailUrl":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54976521170_26a4c3ee46_w.jpg","fullUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lpubeltapp/54976521170/in/album-72177720330595608/","sequenceId":12,"fullSizeUrl":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54976521170_e4ceb9ee7e_o.jpg"},{"title":"By: CollateralTech","subtitle":"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0","thumbnailUrl":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54976224271_6996d48c7d_w.jpg","fullUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lpubeltapp/54976224271/in/album-72177720330595608/","sequenceId":16,"fullSizeUrl":"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54976224271_a72fdf9d59_o.jpg"}]},{"id":"2026-003","year":2026,"potNumber":0,"title":"The Paladin","winnerCount":1,"displayName":"","description":"(Photo pending)\\n*Town Crier enters.* Hear ye, hear ye!
