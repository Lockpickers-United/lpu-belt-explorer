const e=`This is the beginning of your journey of self-discovery that will test the limits of your mind, body, and spirit. Your belt is white because you are like freshly fallen snow, pure, true of heart and ready to be molded into a lockpicking machine.

Both photos and videos of your picking accomplishment are accepted for this rank.

**Requirements**

- Pick any lock with any tool.

**Evidence format**

- Photos or vídeos, showing turned core.

Both photos and videos of your picking accomplishment are accepted for this rank.

**Requirements**

- Pick one of the locks ranked as yellow belt.

**Evidence format**

- Photos or vídeos, showing turned core.
`,o=`Those security pins designed to keep you out are powerless against you. You're starting to find locks containing them easier to pick than those without. Your family is also starting to look at you and your growing collection of locks a bit strangely. It's OK -- we understand you. Let's get an orange belt on you to confuse them further.

**Requirements**

- Pick (SPP or rake) one of the locks ranked as Orange Belt.

**Details**

- If the lock can be dissasembled, you must submit a **video** of your picking accomplishments for this rank. Videos must be in one continuous take.
- For locks that cannot be disassembled, photographs showing the turned core are sufficient.
`,t=`Higher quality locks with even more security pins. Some of these locks have
dead cores, and it's not just because you've picked them to death. It might
also be that you have started down the dimple lock road. You've also started
your development as a lock surgeon, gutting them and getting them back
together again.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP (single pin pick) one of the locks ranked as Green Belt. Raking is not allowed for Green Belt and above.

**Non-Picking Requirements**

- Demonstrate your ability to gut locks.
- Demonstrate your ability to reassemble locks (the reassembly can be a different lock and even in a separate video).

**Evidence format**

- You must **video** picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take, **pictures are no longer accepted at this rank**, even for locks that cannot be disassembled. Your video should include a clear close-up of the pins from the lock.
- For locks that cannot be gutted -- e.g. Master Lock #410 LOTO -- video documentation of gutting a different lock will be accepted.
- You can document the reassembly skill with a different lock and even in a separate video, you do not have to reassemble in the same take.
- The lock you reassemble doesn't have to be the same lock you gutted.
- Reassembly evidence is only required once for Green Belt, and is not required for further submissions. 
- Please, please be sure to read the **[video submission guidelines](/#/info?id=video-requirements)** before submitting your video.

`,i=`Transitionary phase in your mastery. You are leaving the relative calm and predictable world of standard locks behind and dipping a toe into the strange and bizarre world of high-security locks.
