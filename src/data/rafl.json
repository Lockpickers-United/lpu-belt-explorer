Some people may enjoy these by blindly taking one at random, but others will find it more pleasing to line them up like an OCD person and methodically complete one color before moving on to the next. I personally found each of these to be a good experience and would recommend this pot for a beginner to intermediate picker looking for a broad experience ascending the ranks.",
