Everyone's favorite /r/lockpicking and LPU tradition is back! Welcome to the 2024 Lockpicking Charity Raffle, it's going to be a riot as always. Every year the community pulls out their crafting tools and digs into their collections to put up some amazing prizes that are winnable only through a combination of charity donations and good luck! The past couple of years we have gotten perilously close to hitting the $50k mark, and I've got a feeling we just might pass it this time around.

**Ticket entries will be accepted through January 31, and the primary prize drawing will happen via livestream on Thursday, February 1 (evening PST, exact time TBD).**
