### About the Raffle

Everyone's favorite /r/lockpicking and LPU tradition is back! Welcome to the 2024 Lockpicking Charity Raffle, it's going to be a riot as always. Every year the community pulls out their crafting tools and digs into their collections to put up some amazing prizes that are winnable only through a combination of charity donations and good luck! The past couple of years we have gotten perilously close to hitting the $50k mark, and I've got a feeling we just might pass it this time around.

**Ticket entries will be accepted through January 31, and the primary prize drawing will happen via livestream on Thursday, February 1 (evening PST, exact time TBD).**

### Rules

Each US dollar equivalent (rounded down) donated counts as one “ticket” in the drawing.

A list of charities that have been vetted in previous raffles can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UW9_qNxzfnPB-cDWIO6E0MC1wyrJL3ddBHW-7SfJH6I/.
Unfortunately, we are not adding new charities to the list this year, as it is a time-consuming process, and we do not have the bandwidth available this time around. However, there are plenty of wonderful choices already present!

Members of the raffle team with access to internal info about donations are not allowed to participate. This is done to ensure that the process remains fair.

There is a maximum prize limit of 3 that can be won by a single individual. We love it when people donate big, but we also want to make sure that the field does not get swept by a small number of individuals.

### How the prize limit works:

Anyone can put as many tickets on as many different pots as they want.
The drawing will occur as normal with no changes.

Anyone who wins a number of pots above the limit will need to choose which ones they would like to keep.

All of the unkept pots will be placed back into circulation and redrawn in a second stream that will occur on Saturday, February 4.

Anyone who goes above the pot limit during the secondary stream will have until the end of the stream to specify what they would like to put back into circulation, or the last pot(s) they won will be redrawn by default.
