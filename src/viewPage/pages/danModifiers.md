There are special cases in which the Dan Point value for a lock is modified to reflect the amount of work and skill that was required to open it. Achievements below apply a specific multipler to the normal Dan points for the lock as ranked.

A **Public First** is defined as the first public video (or other evidence) of picking/defeating a specific ranked lock. Multiplier will be applied even if the open was documented before the classification of the lock. Please note that picking/defeating very similar locks, or identical locks under different brands, will not be considered a public first.

**Notable opens** are generally awarded for locks that have stood unpicked or undefeated for some time despite the communities efforts to attack them. Notable locks may also include those with a distinctly novel locking mechanism, minor changes in pin count, etc. will not be treated as Notable.  Submissions of "Notable" firsts must be approved by the Mod team.

The following modifiers are recognized:

**First Recorded Pick** - 1.5x Dan Points, 2.5x for Notable Locks
- The first public video (or other evidence) of picking a specific ranked lock.

**First Recorded Defeat** - 1.5x Dan Points, 2x for Notable Locks
- Demonstrating and documenting a non-picking method of defeating a lock which has no known prior defeats. Defeat must be performed non-destructively.

**Novel Non-Picking Defeat** - 0.75x Dan Points
- This includes locks which have existing known defeat methods as long as the new approach is materially different from existing ones. Note that this modifier can only be applied once to a specific lock by the picker, no matter how many new approaches they discover.
