# Earn Lockpicking Karate Flair

As a way to have fun (perhaps at the expense of Six Sigma) this sub gives its members the opportunity to earn user flair in the form of karate belts. Belt flair is issued based on the accomplishments of the member, with each higher level requiring increased community participation and the picking of increasingly difficult locks.

Karate Belt Flair is entirely optional and members will go "unranked" until they specifically requests ranking by [messaging the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flockpicking). The moderators do not actively monitor the sub and all requests must go through modmail, posts requesting a belt will be removed.

Remember this is all just for fun... In the end, no matter what karate belt you wear, you're still just wearing fancy pajamas.
