Higher quality locks with even more security pins. Some of these locks have
dead cores, and itâ€™s not just because you've picked them to death. It might
also be that you have started down the dimple lock road. You've also started
your development as a lock surgeon, gutting them and getting them back
together again.

You must **video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take**,
pictures are no longer accepted at this rank, even for locks that cannot be
disassembled.

- FOR NON GUTTABLE LOCKS (IE. Master 410 LOTO) Video documentation of
  gutting and reassembling a different lock will be accepted.

Check out the KOD [guide to making pick and gut videos](https://youtu.be/gcekRz-7If8) if you not familiar with the
process. Remember, [vertical video hurts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dechvhb0Meo).

Requirements:

1. Demonstrate your ability to gut locks.
2. Demonstrate your ability to reassemble locks (the reassembly can be a different lock and even in a separate video).
3. SPP (single pin pick) one of the locks ranked as green belt or similar.
