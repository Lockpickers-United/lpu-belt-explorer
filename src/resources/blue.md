Transitionary phase in your mastery. You are leaving the relative calm and
predictable world of standard locks behind and dipping a toe into the
strange and bizarre world of high-security locks. You are frequently
pinning your own locks, making challenge locks, and helping newer members
of the lockpicking community as they progress.

You must video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take.

#### Requirements:

1. Demonstrate your ability to gut locks and get them back together again
2. Demonstrated history of helping new pickers, either on the sub and/or
   in the Discord channel
3. Have built a "Challenge Lock" and shared it with a fellow picker. Please visit the "Read More..." link below for more
   information on this requirement.
4. SPP and gut one of the locks ranked as blue belt or similar

Note: If picking an SFIC, be sure to review the guidelines listed under SFIC Filming Requirements for validating
your lock in the picking video. Please visit the "Read More..." link below for filming requirements.
