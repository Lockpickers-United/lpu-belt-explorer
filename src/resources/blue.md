Transitionary phase in your mastery. You are leaving the relative calm and 
predictable world of standard locks behind and dipping a toe into the 
strange and bizarre world of high-security locks. You are frequently 
pinning your own locks, making challenge locks, and helping newer members 
of the lockpicking community as they progress.

You must video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take.

#### Requirements:

1.  Demonstrate your ability to gut locks and get them back together again
2.  Demonstrated history of helping new pickers, either on the sub and/or 
in the Discord channel
3.  Have built a Challenge Lock and shared it with a fellow picker. Please 
see the information above for more information on this requirement.
4.  SPP and gut one of the locks ranked as blue belt or similar
