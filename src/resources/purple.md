You are now picking locks that are categorically hi-sec. They have two or
more discrete locking mechanisms and are considered unpickable by nearly
every locksmith on the planet. You are helping new pickers frequently
and sharing challenge locks.

You must video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take.

**Requirements**

1. Demonstrate your ability to gut locks and get them back together again
2. Demonstrated history of helping new pickers
3. Have built a "Challenge Lock" and shared it with a fellow picker. Please visit the "Read More..." link below for more
   information.
4. SPP and gut two different locks ranked as Purple Belt (locks have to be from separate entries in the list) or
   similar.

If picking an SFIC, be sure to review the guidelines listed under SFIC Filming Requirements for validating your lock in
the picking video. Please visit the "Read More..." link below for more filming requirements.
