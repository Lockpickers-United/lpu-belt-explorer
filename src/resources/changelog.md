### Recent Changes: February&ndash;May, 2023

**New Additions**

* **Mul-T-Lock Interactive (4 pins, spooled drivers) (Blue)** An old change that was never officially listed but has precedent.
* **Mul-T-Lock Interactive (4 pins, serrated drivers) (Purple)** An old change that was never officially listed but has precedent.
* **Hori Trident (Spools) (Red)** Another version of the Hori Trident, a very difficult HPC lock with a round keyway that fits well in Red.
* **Medeco M4 (Red)** The new Medeco now with a sidebar and barrels - plenty for red.
* **iNAHO Tierkey (3 row, short format) (Blue)** A short HPC lock.
* **CAVEO TS007 Exterior (Purple)** A dimple and slider lock, fitting in well with the other similar locks in Purple.
* **Capitol magnetic cam lock (Purple)** Similar in difficulty to the Miwa Magnetic cam that is already in Purple.
* **Clavis 10 pin (dual row, all spools) (Purple)** A HPC spooled lock without too many pins.
* **Ruko Combi 900 (Purple)** Like an ASSA 600 barrels but with an extra sidepin, this is not hard enough for brown.
* **Lucznik LC (Blue)** Simple to pick normally, but the trap pins that engage make it difficult to pick completely.
* **Lucznik E8 (Blue)** A simple lock with a tough keyway and tight tolerances.
* **Abloy Easy (Black 2)** Another Abloy with the usual difficulties.
* **Abloy Sento (Black 2)** As above.
* **Mul-T-Lock Classic Pro / MTL 400 (Purple)** A variation on the MTL Classic, but with spooling on the inners and some countermilled drivers - setting it apart but not difficult enough for an upgrade.
* **Abus XPlus (Brown)** An Abus plus without butterflies and with a blocker, but the ease of bypassing the blocker limits this to brown.
* **ASSA 500 with Barrel drivers and matched sleeve (Blue)** In line with the countermilled version.
* **ASSA 700 with Gin drivers and matched sleeve (Red)** Similar to the ASSA 600 gins, but with 1 extra pin. Remains in red difficulty range.
* **Mailboss "12" wafer mailbox camlock (Orange)** A wafer cam lock.

**Upgrades**

* **Sargent Mortise (Orange -> Green)** Tolerances make this harder than most other orange locks.
* **ASSA 500 (with gin spools and matching countermilling) (Purple -> Brown)** In line with the upgrade of the gin 600, this one also deserves to go up one rank.
* **Tokoz Pro (Red -> BB1)** A clone of the Protec, this lock is easily difficult enough for black.
* **JPM Surf / Ruko Combi Plus (Red -> BB1)** An ASSA lock with a sidebar, self-explanatory.
