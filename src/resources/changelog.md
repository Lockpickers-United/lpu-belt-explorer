### Recent Changes: Nov. 2022&ndash;Feb. 2023

**New Additions**

* **Dorma DC400 (Blue)** Interesting spools and tight tolerances make blue logical, though quite difficult amongst blue locks.
* **Yanai R 2200M (Black 2)** A clone of the Clavis T20, this Japanese HPC lock is similar in difficulty.
* **Goal S (5 pins) (Blue)** Similar to the Goal P and Z with less pins, blue seems to be an easy decision.
* **Abus S6+ (Blue)** Spools and T-pins with tight tolerances make blue obvious.
* **ASSA Twin Combi with Gin Drivers (Black 2)** A very rare lock, the addition of gin drivers means floating is needed, but the extra isolation keeps this lock at the same level as the barrel version.
* **M&C Matrix without Sidebar (Blue)** Easy to overset, this downgrade of the M&C Matrix fits in at blue.
* **Fuki Tierkey (Brown)** A 3 row HPC, this lock features many spools. Clear feedback, room to maneuvre, and the ability to preset leaves this lock as a solid brown.
* **Cism Atlas (Red)** Now that this lock has been picked with feedback, its original ranking has been restored.

**Upgrades**

* **Kaba Ace (&ge;13 pins) (Brown -> Red)** Standard pins in 3 rows with extraordinary tolerances means this lock is uniquely challenging.
* **Kaba Ace (<13 pins) (Purple -> Brown)** Upgraded alongside the other version.

**Downgrades**

* **Abloy Protec2 (Black 4 -> Black 3)** A new method being discovered means this lock is no more difficult than the Protec.
* **Abus D6 (Blue -> Green)** Despite the spools, this lock is lacking in difficulty for blue.
* **Mottura Champions C30/C31/C39 (Blue -> Green)** As the magnetic element does not consistently work, there are far too many samples of this lock that are missing its unique feature, so it has been downgraded.
* **Fichet-Bauche M2B / M3B / MxB (Black 2 -> Black 1)** Beyond the need for toolmaking, this is simply 8 tapered levers. There has been recent news of another more difficult version that will be added in a higher rank as more information comes.
* **Mottura Champions C43/C44/C48 (Black 1 -> Red)** A tentative change, this lock has been reduced to red for the time being due to some feedback. It will be monitored and returning to Black 1 will be considered in the near future.
* **Abloy Classic (Red -> Brown)** A second downgrade for this lock, once tooling is looked past, this lock is a standard DD lock with false gates.
* **Western Electric 29A/B (Black 2 -> Purple)** Relabelled from Western Electric 29B, this lock has been downgraded thanks to a new method and more information on the lock - it features only 5 unsprung levers with false gates or 4 unsprung smooth levers and 1 sprung lever with false gates, and as such is far from black.
* **Fichet F3D (indoor cylinder) (Black 4 -> Black 1)** A difficult lock in theory, this lock is unfortunately easy to accidentally open in the picking process, which causes it to be significantly weaker than its exterior version.
* **Walsall locks, Ace - 7 levers (Black 1 -> Purple)** This lock was ranked by some mistake, as it features 7 false gated levers and an open keyway, being a lever lock often recommended to beginners.

**Changes to Listing**

* **Robur Safe Deposit Lock (barrels < 3 chambers with matched milling)** and **Robur Safe Deposit Lock (gins < 3 chambers with matched milling)** are now samelined as with few security pins, they are almost identical locks. The versions with 3 or more security pins remain separate.
* **West 916 -> West 916 / West 955** These are almost identical HPC locks.
* **Miwa E6 -> Miwa E6 / Miwa 83EC** The 83EC has 2 less top pins and the same magnetic elements, which are the main part of the lock.
* **S&G 4540 -> S&G 4544/4545** Renamed for clarity.
* **Yardeni -> Yardeni 6** Renamed for clarity.

**Clarification**

* **Fichet F3D External Cylinder** is considered an upgrade of Fichet F3D Indoor Cylinder.
