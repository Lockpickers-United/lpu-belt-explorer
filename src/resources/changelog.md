## Changes to Lock Rankings

From time to time we may change the rankings of certain locks. These changes may be due to refined or new picking
techniques making locks that were once difficult to pick, less so, or simply because we've decided they were improperly
ranked in the first place.

If a lock moves up a rank (e.g. from yellow belt to orange belt) that change will take effect immediately. If you notice
a lock you picked last week has been moved up a rank and would now qualify you for a higher belt rank, do request the
new rank.

If a lock moves down a rank (e.g. from orange belt to yellow belt) and you've already picked it, fear not, you've earned
that rank, and we have no intention to revoke a belt rank that was well-earned. We also understand that some locks
require a significant financial and time investment, and you may have already purchased a lock and started working on it
before we announced the lock is being reclassified. When we move a lock down a rank, we will make every effort to state
that we are doing so publicly, and provide an appropriate grace period (generally one month) to allow anyone currently
working on that lock to have time to get their accomplishment ranked at the old belt level.

### June - August 2025


**NEW ADDITIONS**

- **IKON SK6** Sperrwelle (4 finger pins, non-chamfered sidebar) - RED. Has 3+ votes by our classification community.
- **Mauer Crypto** - RED. Has 3+ votes by our classification community.
- **Nagasawa KCY-7x** - PURPLE. Has 3+ votes by our classification community.
- **Securystar Pro Star** - PURPLE. Has 3+ votes by our classification community.
- **Omellow R3** - BLUE. Has 3+ votes by our classification community.
- **ABUS 82/63** - ORANGE. This is the monoblock ABUS normal profile lock with only spools and a regular pin, similar to E50 in pinning. It is also not guttable.

**SAMELINES**

- **CISA RS3** - sameline with ABUS EP10 / Bricard Chifral as this is the same lock.
- **DOM PP1024** - sameline with DOM S. The term "PP1024" does not identify a lock model but a profile series for DOM S. Since many people confuse it for a model name and it often says "PP1024" on the key, having it listed by profile name under DOM S helps identifying.
- **DOM RS Sirius** - sameline with DOM RS Sigma. This is basically the same lock with some copy protection pin added on the side.
- **ISEO R50** - sameline with ISEO R7. This lock is no different than R7, except for a "bump" on the key interacting with one of the top row pins instead of having a flat profile (copy protection) - apart from that, they are exactly the same.
- **ISEO F5** (4-pins) - sameline with ISEO F5 on orange as the one pin does not really change much and it's still too difficult for yellow.
- **Burg WÃ¤chter 222 C30** (4-pin) - sameline with C40. The C30 has 1 pin less but they are too difficult for white with their profile, no matter if 4 or 5 pins.
- **Mottura C9P / C43 Plus** - sameline with C43 as this is the same lock with same internals.
- **WLN Detector** - sameline with Tann Detector (same lock).

**SPLITS**

- **Yanai R2200M** - <14 pins - RED. Splitting similar to Goal v18.
- **Yanai R2200M** - 14-16 pins - BB1. Splitting similar to Goal v18.
- **Yanai R2200M** - >= 17 pins - BB2 . Splitting similar to Goal v18.

**REMOVALS**

- **ASSA 500** with gins and countermilling - there is no evidence that this lock ever existed. All instances of ASSA 500 with gins observed so far were the sleeve version. Nobody has brought forth any evidence that a version with gin milling in the core actually exists or ever existed.
