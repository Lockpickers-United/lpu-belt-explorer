### August-October 2024

**NEW ADDITIONS**

- **Axa Clinch** (GREEN) basic DD lock - Beginner level DD
- **GSK dual row sidebar lock** (PURPLE) - another interesting lock with tapered elements
- **DOM IX 6 KG** (PURPLE) - Another DOM enters the family, this time similar to an ix 5kg, but with 6 nasty pin stacks


**DOWNGRADES**
- **Commando Peacemaker** downgrade to ORANGE -  so these have security pins but tolerances don't seem to make it that hard to pick
- **FTH Thirard Surveyor** downgrade to BROWN - These pump locks are mostly destined to be downgraded as more people pick them - they are fun y'all!


**UPGRADE**

- **Alpha FB (<15 pins)** - change to <12 for BROWN, upgrade 12 or more pins to RED. As 15+ pins FB seem like a unicorn, they are still very challenging to pick, so a new division was decided on
