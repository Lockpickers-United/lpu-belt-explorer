### Recent Changes: December 2023&ndash;March 2024

**New Additions**

- **Yale Y120 series brass padlocks all formats** (ORANGE) Nice spools and fun pick, if not super difficult.

- **Brady Safekey** (GREEN) This weird looking LOTO will need some inventiveness to tension, and uses some pump action as a security feature. Not as hard as it might look at first, but the lack of false gates makes it much easier than it could have been.

- **Viro Palladium PV** (GREEN) This Italian dimple + slider lock’s main challenge is the main stack. The sliders, they occasionally set themselves. Could have used a bit more security features.

- **Solon Super-Lock Company Nix Pix** (GREEN) A classic, American made pump lock, reminding us of the Bramah lock of old, is a small fun challenge for those wanting to adventure into the world of slider pump locks. Good luck finding one (for an affordable price)!

- **ABUS GDS tree version** (GREEN) ABUS response to ASSA, using tree pins, but instead of countermilling, they decided to… overmill? I mean, straight flat top overmill?? Cheesus… no wonder it’s just green belt!

- **ABUS GDS barrel version** (BLUE) Well this was a surprise, after all not all GDS are created equal, and some use “ASSA” barrel drivers. Same overmilling nonsense, but seems in this case, barrels make it more challenging… a bit.

- **Alpha "Z" cam lock** (BLUE) A tiny dimple cam lock from the known Japanese brand, cute key and fair challenge.

- **DOM IX Teco** (PURPLE) Looks like the Plura turned sideways, with some nipple pins for your pleasure… or not.

- **JPM Quartz UP** (BROWN) Nearly the same pinning as a TESA TX80, but as one of the pickers put it, “what a TESA TX80 wishes it could be”. Frenchies 1: Spaniards 0

- **TESA T-10 / T-12** (BROWN) This was a tough delivery. Similar to a Kale Kilit BNE or an ABUS EC700, with the main stack oversetting a row of opposing pins, and lots of tapered action, it seems to sit between those two examples, at least in difficulty.

- **Alpha ED** cam lock, 14 pins in 4 directions, standard and mushroom drivers (BROWN) Another Alpha cam, this time, the engineers thought “let’s make it like an Alpha FB, but tiny”. Crazy Japanese lockmakers…

- **Fichet-Bauche Monopole** (BROWN) Hey look who it is! Our favourite French ~~asshole~~ lock! Very appropriate, as it will literally give you shit!

- **MIWA SR** (RED) Another MIWA for the list, this time a wafeeeeessssliiiidd… uhhhh… something with a sidebar lock? Yeah, those guys make crazy stuff, but the lock looks awesome! (want one!)

- **KABA Matrix** (BB1) So this is a weird one, as many pickers have confirmed it should be identical to Gemini, being an apparent upgrade, but somehow it’s harder to pick. Took a bunch of people confirming that to avoid it being samelined to the Gemini. Let’s see if it keeps that way.



**Upgrades**

- **Securemme K22** – upgraded to PURPLE - nasty feedback, #$%§y small pins… It’s not super hard to pick, but you can pick it once and spend hours trying to pick it again and can’t understand why you can’t feel anything.

- **Mauer Red Line GM** - upgraded to PURPLE - Need a long tool for this big boi. If you got short tool, you can wiggle around all you want but you won’t get the final satisfaction… of picking it open.

- **Burg Wächter Alpha 800** - upgraded to BROWN - This is probably BW’s best padlock, heavy, strong and with a very pick resistant wafer mechanism?… Oh yeah, and the core is split. In half. Through the middle. Like, you tension it from one side and one half splits to the left and another to the right, making nearly impossible to get any feedback that way. Hope you have a y-wrench for this one.



**Description Changes and Samelinings**

- **Yale Y110/40** changed to **Y110 series brass padlocks all formats** 40mm or larger (includes Y113 and Y114, excludes iron body disc detainer Y112) - looks like all have the same pinning. Fun spoolly action!

- Samelining **RUKO 700 sleeved** to **ASSA 700 sleeved** - but remember, only on full moon nights on the 30th day of the second month between midnight and 1:00 GMT. Else, Ruko will be impossible.

- Samelining **RUKO MERKUR** to **ASSA P600** - meh, they are both impossible, but Ruko is more impossible, of course.

- Samelining **UCEM T200** and **Picard VTX** with **Titan T250** - Adding the UCEM and Picard versions to the existing ranked Tital. They all look similar enough to don’t matter the difference. Pretty fun pick with unsprung sliders.

- Samelining **Alfa "pExtra"** with **Gege pExtra**, **Alfa "AP1000"**, and **Gege AP1000** (Alfa models unknown, plug millings and pinnings equivalent are to be samelined) - Alfa seem to be a variant brand of Gege, that is sold in Scandinavian countries. Often pinned very similar to Gege, as long as they are pinned the same as the original Gege AP1000 and pExtra, and have the same style of keyways and milling, they will count as such.

- Samelining **Avocet ABS*** with ranked **Federal Locks** and **Thirard Federal S and 2** (Federal U-systems (UCF/UCH/UCS/UUS)-3100, Thirard Federal S, Thirard Federal 2) - When we found out that Federal made Avocet ABS and the Thirard equivalents, finding all the other Federal locks that are exactly the same brought us a pretty impressive list. It’s worth it, some of these are more common than others, and it’s a pretty cool pick.

- Samelining **Yale Platinum** with **Yale Superior** - just a formality. Y’all knew this already… I assume.

- **Mul-T-Lock Classic and Interactive** will be changed to:
    - MTL Classic/Jr/Interactive w/4 or more spools - purple
    - MTL Classic/Interactive w/4 or more serrated drivers - brown
    - MTL Interactive plus pinned to factory spec (includes the countermilled outer keypins and spooled inner drivers) - brown
    - MTL400 / Classic Pro (includes the countermilled outer keypins and spooled inner drivers) - purple
    - So to simplify: no need to count and show outer keypin countermilling; MTL interactive plus will for now count as brown belt if pinned to factory specifications, even if they don’t agree with the previous count of milled pins. MTL interactive (no plus), Jr. or Classic with spools will count as blue or purple depending on number of spools. Simpler, eh? …. No?.... well…. _changes subject_

- **Caveo** description changed to "all standards" or "with spools" - Apparently some interior CAVEO have spools, so, this way will be a better way to define them.

- Adding **T65AL** as additional denomination for **Abus MyLock** - Some locks have multiple names, and Abus smartass name-givers decided some of these padlocks would have “myLock” as a main name, but others would just have the model number as designation. This will prevent confusion.

- **Miwa U9** added in version "with barred false gates (old shallow false gates equals a belt below)"
  Let’s see how we’re going to check this, but looks like a good camera will be needed for anyone wanting some more Dan points…
