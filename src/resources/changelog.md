## Changes to Lock Rankings

From time to time we may change the rankings of certain locks. These changes may be due to refined or new picking
techniques making locks that were once difficult to pick, less so, or simply because we've decided they were improperly
ranked in the first place.

If a lock moves up a rank (e.g. from yellow belt to orange belt) that change will take effect immediately. If you notice
a lock you picked last week has been moved up a rank and would now qualify you for a higher belt rank, do request the
new rank.

If a lock moves down a rank (e.g. from orange belt to yellow belt) and you've already picked it, fear not, you've earned
that rank, and we have no intention to revoke a belt rank that was well-earned. We also understand that some locks
require a significant financial and time investment, and you may have already purchased a lock and started working on it
before we announced the lock is being reclassified. When we move a lock down a rank, we will make every effort to state
that we are doing so publicly, and provide an appropriate grace period (generally one month) to allow anyone currently
working on that lock to have time to get their accomplishment ranked at the old belt level.

Visit the #belt-changelog channel in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/lockpicking) for more information on all changes.

### February/March 2025

**NEW ADDITIONS**

-  **Chain Key Lock** - BLUE - This lock has received some testing through the recent group buy and received 3 convincing blue community votes.
- **Opnus XZ** - BLUE - as voted by our community.
- **Delta 'DAF Kilit DBS02' Clone** - PURPLE - Has 3 votes to purple by our BB community and aligns with similar locks like Yale Superior.
- **Yale 2000 Plus** - PURPLE - This is a 10 dimple + slider sidebar style lock with 3 community votes to purple. Similar to other purple locks, e.g. M&C Matrix or Color Pro, but generally considered slightly harder due to the higher amount of pins.
- **U-Shin Showa mortise** (6 spools, torpedo keypins) - BLUE - as voted by our community.
- **Keso 8000 Omega^2** - BROWN (< 13 pins) / RED (>= 13 pins). The 8000 is a true upgrade to previous Kesos in two ways: 1) The Omega^2 element is harder to set than the previous element and 2) (more importantly) since Keso 8000, Keso uses a sleeve (like Kaba) instead of trays. This method of manufacturing allows for much tighter tolerances (because sleeve and core are drilled in one pass) which is why Keso 8000 feels harder to pick. Since the pin count varies, we decided to apply a similar rule for pin count as for the other Kesos.
- **Kaba Titan** - BB1 - Voted unanimously to BB1 by 3 community members.
- **West 941** - BB3 - as voted by our community.

**SAMELINING**

- **Keso 1000** - sameline with 10RS/2000/4000. Even though these can be slightly more difficult, they are still about in the same difficulty range.
