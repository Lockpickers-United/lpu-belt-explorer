### April-August 2024

**NEW ADDITIONS**

- **Brinks 164 padlock** (YELLOW) A basic common lock, nice for beginners

- **Heracles Y7** (YELLOW) Another basic lock, this time a dimple lock, adding options to beginners. Still, how bad a lock can you be to get yellow belt being a dimple? SMH

- **Heracles 5G** (ORANGE) Not much to it, just a French orange belt lock. Moving along…

- **Vachette HDI** (BLUE) Similar to the VIP, has only one security driver compared to VIP’s all standards. Three french locks in a row, seems like our French members’ plot is working

- **Ruko Garant with Gins** Samelined with ASSA Twin Combi with Gins

- **Yale 112 disc detainer** (ORANGE) Here’s a disc detainer by a big brand, that is not better than a chinese-made brandless disc detainer. Bravo!

- **Yale 122/50** (ORANGE) Similar to the Y110, just bigger and heavier. Just like my -----

- **Abus 5/45 Silver Rock** (ORANGE) That’s an ok padlock, with some spools to bring it to orange belt. Can’t think of anything smart of funny to say here. Abus is not very funny.

- **Ace tubular** (ORANGE) Nothing to see here, it’s just a tubular lock, move on…

- **Sepa 5000** (GREEN) Probably the most basic high pin count lock ever ranked. For you HPC lovers, should be a walk in the park. For the others, might be good intro to this lock type

- **Cobra C3 Sidewinder** (BLUE) Annoying little sliders. Cool name though.

- **CAVEO TS007, all standards** (BLUE) Like its big brother, but no security pins

- **Kromer Novum** (RED) Another high ranking Kromer. Anyone even believes there is such thing as an “easy” Kromer?

- **FTH Thirard Pacific** (RED) Another Bramah inspired French lock I must find to add to my collection. Pump locks are fun!

- **Miwa LS7** (RED) Japan locks represent! Another annoyingly simple but expertly designed lock with incredible pick resistance. Can Miwa make bad locks even?

- **Maglok** (RED) There had to be at least one magnetic lock, and this is a challenging one. And so cool looking!

- **Miwa LS10** (BB1) As if 7 sliders weren’t enough, here’s 10, for even more pick resistance.

- **Fichet 787, interior** (BB3) For long time staying publicly unpicked, has been vanquished by a few of our own more recently. Now to hoping the exterior section gets picked soon… (_insert spongebob meme_ 2000 years later…)

**UPGRADES**

- **ABUS C73/C83/C90 new pinning** - upgraded to BLUE - That change in standard pinning brought much more pick resistance compared to the old version, a good challenge for a low security lock, and another European cheap option for Blue belt. (Americans only have paclock _snickers_)

- **ABUS XP20s/XP2s, CISA AP3, Bricard XP S2** - upgrade to BROWN - Yeah, this was to be expected. But for this one to count for brown, you can’t keep the interactive pressed throughout picking. That’s the main issue with this lock, that weird interactive.

**CHANGES**

- **ASSA/Ruko 500 gin drivers and matching counter milling** ranked Brown - Removed Ruko (up to now, no examples have been found)

- **CISA AP4S and Bricard Mistral S** Samelined with ABUS XP20s/XP2s, CISA AP3, Bricard XP S2

- **Mul-t-lock interactive (+) with spooled drivers, 5+ pins** - All versions of interactives with 4+ spools will be changed to PURPLE – probably one of the most controversial changes here, but we’re going back to the original ranking of the MTL classic and interactive (+) locks with spooled drivers. Although the countermilling of the outer keypins matched with inner spooled drivers has been considered harder than purple, it has also been consistently hard to show on video, making it difficult for the mods to accept those videos for Brown belt. An attempt was made to simplify this matter by making only MTL interactive+ brown belt, but there has been evidence of inconsistent pinning, as well as evidence that in many places they are pinned by locksmiths without consideration to what should be the “standard” pinning for each model. In sum, a very inconsistent lock in pinning and ability to use it for brown belt resulted in simplification by all the versions going back samelined to Purple belt, no consideration made to the countermilling. Sorry.
