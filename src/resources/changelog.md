### Recent Changes: September&ndash;November, 2023

**New Additions**

* **Alpha 1000 - up to 35mm (White)**
* **Alpha 1000 - 40-45mm (Yellow)**
* **Alpha 1000 - 50mm or larger (Orange)** These Alphas seem to be as basic as they come, pretty locks nonetheless, and nice additions to the bottom of our rankings.
* **GLK 60G50 (50mm padlock) (Yellow)** A very basic padlock with meh tolerances. Made in Portugal.
* **GLK G10 (Yellow)** I do think this one is a bit underranked here, but it's a pretty weird 10 pin dimple lock overall that shouldn't be much trouble for most pickers.
* **IFAM Start 50 Padlock (Yellow)** Same as the GLK padlock, except Made in Spain. Which means, not at all alike - and don't you dare say they are the same!!
* **Cisa 220/50 (Orange)** Nice cool padlock with spools, good challenge for those learning to pick them, deserves being at Orange.
* **FAB Control (Orange)** Although it does have a pretty suprise inside, it's not harder to pick than a normal orange lock. Tricky but doable keyway.
* **ABUS Magtec 1500 (Green)** Orange belt lock requiring a magnet pick, or at least a magnet to be pushed into place. Interesting mechanism, but easy to take care of.
* **American Lock 1160 (Green)** We wondered if an extra pin stack would make an 1100 harder to pick. So we worked day and night to figure that out. Well, apparently, they are not harder enough to pick to rank it blue. Waste of time, really.
* **An Jia Bao / HPP / Ming Gao disc detainer padlock (Green)** This group is much bigger than the names defined here. In reality, any padlock with the same type of keybow could probably get in this group. They are all made the same way. They are hundreds...
* **CCL Sesamee 900 series (Green)** an American 1100 clone with some interesting internals, looks very cool. Gotta get one of those one day. _Looks at wallet._ Damn.
* **Cisa 285 (Green)** Keyway is nasty. But that's about it. Good tolerances, nice spools, makes it a strong Green. And it's a very nice looking and guttable padlock too.
* **D&eacute;ny 3 lever, Trap door (Green)** Don't know much about it, except you got a trap door, so you need to get through it to pick at the levers. Despite that it looks like it's easy enough to pick. Leave it to the French to make it complicated in all the wrong places.
* **Digby Lock and Tool Bravo (Green)** First time a limited run lock made by one of our own enters the lock ranks. The incredible tolerances make it pretty challenging even with fairly simple pinning. Don't be fooled, that's a dark green lock. If it were up to me it would be higher ranked. _There, I said it, I'll be expecting my free Bravo next month, Digs_
* **FJM Padlock (Green)** A disc detainer padlock that might be one of the best beginner choices when it comes to this locking mechanism. And looks pretty good too!
* **Unity Disc Detainer Padlock (Green)** Another great beginners' lock for disc detainer practice.
* **Yale 1000, Yale 1500 (Green)** Tapered is the word of this one. Shouldn't be much of a problem for an experienced picker but might be a patience tester for a dimple beginner.
* **Dejo 7 pin (tapered spools, trees, no milling) (Blue)** How this ASSA 700 clone manages to be so annoying without milling, I don't know. But the truth is, it's good enough to reach Blue Belt.
* **Dorma DC4300 (AKA Miller's Dorma), Elite DC4300 (Blue)** Similar to Dorma DC3003, but 6 pins instead of 7. Another Dorma that has trouble knowing if it wants to be an ASSA or a Gege.
* **IKON RW6 (Blue)** Once you get through the lockpicker-designed keyway, the tapered driver pins might cause you some trouble, but not too much.
* **Yale 2100 (Blue)** You know about Yale Superior? Imagine much better feedback on just 6 pin stacks.
* **ABA Pagoda (Purple)** One of those pagoda locks that works by pushing discs at different heights... Don't even know what to call that mechanism... Weird but cool.
* **Godrej Ultra (14 pins in 3 rows) (Purple)** 14 pins of Indian fun. Another one for the wishlist (nobody tell my wife!)
* **Mindy Pagoda AF 16 (flat key) (Purple)** similar to the ABA pagoda, but usually in an unguttable padlock. Same mechanism probably available in other Chinese brands too.
* **Mottura 3D Key (Purple)** It was time this one got in the belt list, it might be expensive AF but it is also weird AF, so it had to be here. Apparently it's not as hard as it looks, but what a nice looking lock and key.
* **Securemme EVO K64 (Brown)** This one looks like a missed opportunity, as the reverse sidebar doesn't work as well as it could. Bad springs and tolerances make the sidebar ineffective.
* **Bramah bp17 (Red)** A lock with plenty of history behind it, I should get my hands on one too. The technique to pick this one matters a lot, and if it isn't right it will be much harder.
* **Western Electric 30B (Bb5)** You remember Western Electric 30C? Same, but not the same. You get it.


**Upgrades**

* **Mottura Champions C43,C44,C48 (Red -> Black Belt 1)** Well, well, well. Look who's back to Black Belt after all...
* **WEST 917 (Black Belt 1 -> Black Belt 2)** Seems like we needed to whole of Dojo to rise up for this to happen. Or nearly all of it.

**Downgrades**

* **Brinks Weatherproof 44mm laminated padlock (Orange -> Yellow)** Renamed to Brinks Laminated Padlock (with or without Weatherproof) - Looks like all Brinks laminated are the same, so let them be the same... as yellow belts.
* **Fontaine (Purple -> Blue)** The reign of the overranked french pump locks is over.
* **Bowley Door Lock (Black Belt 2 -> Black Belt 1)** Are you really surprised by this drop? I mean... really?
* **Walsall 2000 (Black Belt 1 -> Brown)** Yeah... that's, uh, a big drop....

**Sameline**

* **Lips 8300** Added and samelined with Nemef NF2 - they are nearly the same lock, extra checkpin or no.
* **Lockwood 215A40 and 214A40** Added and samelined with 334B40 - same core, same lock
* **Lockwood 356S63, 270S70** Samelined with 334B40 (see previous.)
