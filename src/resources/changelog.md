### Recent Changes: June&ndash;August, 2023

**New Additions**

* **Master Lock #19 (Purple)** Probably the best and one of the largest Master Locks ever made
* **Yale KM 1 Star Superior (Blue)** Torpedo keypins with 6 Gege style drivers, it's like a Gege, sucks as much to pick it
* **Gege MRT (Brown)** This one's for the magnetheads, a nice hard brown belt magnet lock
* **Master Lock 1921D "100 Anniversary" Padlock (Orange)** Not terrible, not great...
* **Opnus TZ (Purple)** Similar to Opnus UX but 3 rows of pins
* **West YKK AP (Purple)** Like an easier West 916
* **Master Lock 1145-1165 (Orange)** Nice entry level dimple padlocks
* **Baton 6000 series, non Abloy keyway (Blue)** A step up from Zarker, but still a good entry level Disc Detainer
* **U-Shin Showa X Key 8 pin (Blue)**
* **U-Shin Showa X Key 12 pin (Purple)**

**Upgrades**

* **Abus EC75 75/30 padlock (Yellow -> Orange)** Too tricky to stay in yellow... will it stay in orange?
* **Ruko Combi 2 / Ruko Garant 10 / Fab Variant (Red -> Black 1)** Seems like the fact the fingerpin serrations don't match the sidebar doesn't make it much easier than the normal Combi
* **Tesa TE-5 (Yellow -> Orange)** Tapered/serrated drivers are enought to make it annoying enough for orange
* **Gege ANS-2 (Yellow -> Orange)** It's a freaking Gege, need I say more?
* **Abus 75/50 / 75IB/50 (Green -> Blue)** Good tolerances, tension control and dead core make it hard enough to upgrade
* **Burg W채chter Diamant (Green -> Blue)** It's almost the same lock as Gamma 700, and picks very similarly

**Downgrades**

* **Tann Detector/Chubb Detector from 50s (BB2 -> Red)** Not quite black belt material, but still a very hard lock

**Reintroductions**

* **ISEO F3 (Yellow)** This 5 pin, standard drivers cylinder, was unranked because of lack of information.
* **Br체der Mannesmann Padlock** Was unranked for lack of information. Is being re-ranked but split according to size.
 
**Splits**

* **Br체der Mannesmann <50mm [<5pins] (White)** and **Br체der Mannesmann 50mm or larger [5 pins] (Yellow)**
* **Vachette Radial 18+ pins (Black)** and **Vachette Radial <18 pins (Red)**
* **ABUS E-series:. E50 (Orange)** and **E20, E30, E60, E70, E90 (Blue)**

**Sameline**

* **Heracles Vigie** Samelined with Picard Vigie, they are mostly the same lock
* **Dorma DC5400** Identical to DC500 except for format, samelined with it
* **MIWA UR** Very similar to MIWA U9, is to be samelined with it in all versions

**Change Description**
