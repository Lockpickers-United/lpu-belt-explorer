## Changes to Lock Rankings

From time to time we may change the rankings of certain locks. These changes may be due to refined or new picking
techniques making locks that were once difficult to pick, less so, or simply because we've decided they were improperly
ranked in the first place.

If a lock moves up a rank (e.g. from yellow belt to orange belt) that change will take effect immediately. If you notice
a lock you picked last week has been moved up a rank and would now qualify you for a higher belt rank, do request the
new rank.

If a lock moves down a rank (e.g. from orange belt to yellow belt) and you've already picked it, fear not, you've earned
that rank, and we have no intention to revoke a belt rank that was well-earned. We also understand that some locks
require a significant financial and time investment, and you may have already purchased a lock and started working on it
before we announced the lock is being reclassified. When we move a lock down a rank, we will make every effort to state
that we are doing so publicly, and provide an appropriate grace period (generally one month) to allow anyone currently
working on that lock to have time to get their accomplishment ranked at the old belt level.

### January 2025

First change for the new year! We have some adjustments in the higher belts as well as some community votes being implemented.

**NEW ADDITIONS**

- **Basi AS** - ORANGE - Standard 5-pin with two spools, similar to V50.
- **BAB DESS5** - ORANGE - Very old standard 5-pin with two spools and friendly profile.
- **Yale 500+** - GREEN - Version of Yale 500 without overmilling.
- **Wilka PR100 Series** - GREEN - 6-pin Wilka with spools and copy protection element, like 3VE but vertical profile.
- **Winkhaus keyTec RPE** - BLUE - Very complicated profile with newer Winkhaus pinning makes this tricky.

**UPGRADES**

- **Brinks R70/R80** - YELLOW - A 4-pin lock with two spools.
- **Abus Pfaffenhain V14** (with 6 pins and Pfaffenhain pin or AS pins) - BLUE - The combination of pins, profile and trap pin make this difficult enough for blue. Requires 360Â° pick.
- **Keso 10RS / 2000S / 4000S** with >= 13 pins - BROWN - Align with LIPS Keso.
- **Urban Alps Stealth Key Gen2** - BLACK2 - This is more difficult than Gen1 which is currently BLACK.

**SAMELINING**

- Remove **Clavis f22** as an upgrade from Clavis q18 to align with other locks like Kaba.
- **Securemme K2** - Sameline with Securemme K22.
- **Yale B (6-pin with overmilling)** - Sameline with Yale 500.
- **Vachette Radial** - Sameline Radial, Radial SI, Radial NT and NT+ as they are all very similar.
- **ABUS X12R** - Sameline with EC880, same lock.
- **Mottura Champion CP6** - Sameline with C55, same lock without interactive element.
