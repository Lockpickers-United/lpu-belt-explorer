## Changes to Lock Rankings

From time to time we may change the rankings of certain locks. These changes may be due to refined or new picking
techniques making locks that were once difficult to pick, less so, or simply because we've decided they were improperly
ranked in the first place.

If a lock moves up a rank (e.g. from yellow belt to orange belt) that change will take effect immediately. If you notice
a lock you picked last week has been moved up a rank and would now qualify you for a higher belt rank, do request the
new rank.

If a lock moves down a rank (e.g. from orange belt to yellow belt) and you've already picked it, fear not, you've earned
that rank, and we have no intention to revoke a belt rank that was well-earned. We also understand that some locks
require a significant financial and time investment, and you may have already purchased a lock and started working on it
before we announced the lock is being reclassified. When we move a lock down a rank, we will make every effort to state
that we are doing so publicly, and provide an appropriate grace period (generally one month) to allow anyone currently
working on that lock to have time to get their accomplishment ranked at the old belt level.

### November - December 2024

**NEW ADDITIONS**

- **Basi BM** - GREEN - A 6-pin dimple lock that uses DOM security pins as drivers.
- **Basi V50** - ORANGE - Successor of Basi AS, new standard pin tumbler with 5 pins, some spools.
- **Basi V55** - GREEN - Successor of Basi CX6, new standard dimple lock with 6 pins, some spools.
- **Basi K6-RT** - BLUE - A precise 6-pin lock with interactive element, part of the "Made in Germany" line of Basi.
- **GTV 6-pin dimple** - GREEN - A rare 6-pin dimple lock that used to be made by GTV.
- **GTV APS** - GREEN - A 5-pin lock from GTV that was much more precise than the FCV baseline.
- **Gera 3000** - BLUE - Pinning and tolerances usually make these 6 pin locks really challenging to pick.
- **GreenTeq "Q"** - GREEN. This 6-pin normal profile lock usually has two thin spools, falses are slightly harder than normal spools due to large amount of rotation.
- **LOB Standard** - ORANGE - An old 5-pin lock from Poland, 3 mushroom drivers that make it a little more challenging than the usual orange locks.
- **CES 810** (newer normal profile) - GREEN. These 5-pin locks are rather precise, the bitting is usually a high-low bitting of some sort (you need to use a proper - hook here) and it has spools.
- **ABUS EC550 / 660** - BLUE. These are very similar to ABUS D10.
- **ABUS EC880 / P1R** - BLUE. Similar to Bravus but less accurate. Also, the top 4 pins can relock at 180° with drivers 3-6 from the main row. One of the top pins is a regular pin with no key pin "head" so harder to get on top of it, and another one is shaped in such a way that it could trap when overlifted. Requires 360° picking.
- **Winkhaus XR** (5 pins, new pinning with key spools, spools and barrels) - GREEN. The new pins make it harder than the old Trelock-style pinning that Winkhaus used to have.

**DOWNGRADES**

- **BKS Helius** (5 pins) - ORANGE. This lock exists with 5 and 6 pins. Due to its super open keyway and little difference in pin heights, it is rather easy to reach pins. At least with 5 pins, this simply does not offer enough difficulty to justify its green rating.

**UPGRADES**

- **DOM SC/SV** - BLUE. These are basically DOM S (rated green) with an additional pin that's also more tricky to find than a normal stack.
- **ABUS EC75/30** - GREEN. We figured this is too difficult for current orange locks. The profile is really narrow, you only have the unfavorable direction for picking or have to pick from closed side.
- **CES WZ/WM5** - GREEN. These are more difficult than standard 6 pin dimple locks like the BASI CX6 which is green. They are manufactured accurately and the lack of 1 pin does not really justify them only being orange.
- **DOM IX5 HT** (with fins, drop pins or rattle snake drivers) - BLUE. The DOM IX5 kg is rated blue in all configurations. However, the IX5 HT is more difficult in certain configurations because of the HT profile (while the KG is just another pin that is really easy to set). The HT profile "encloses" the pins, making them harder to access.
- **Gege ANS-2** - BLUE. These are much more precise than the usual AP1000 and despite only having 5 pins, their serrated security pins make this a very challenging pick.
- **Wilka Primus HX** - BLUE. This precise 6-pin dimple lock with two additional active elements shares more characteristics with locks on blue than green.
- **ABUS C83** (old, with serrated and spools) - GREEN. One of the older locks that is just too difficult for its current level as it is quite precise and combines two types of security pins (the serrated pin is particularly difficult for beginners).
- **DOM 333 RN** (with either 3 spools or dom pin and torpedo) - GREEN. This lock exists with many pinnings and with more advanced security pins, this is already rated as blue. There are two more common pin configurations though that are too difficult for orange, so we decided to move these up to green.
- **Kale Kilit 164 GCE** - BLUE. This is a very difficult 6 pin lock that is certainly harder than some existing blue belt locks. In particular the very thin profile, combined with tolerances and spools that kick each other out make it tricky.

**SAMELINES AND CHANGES**

- **ABUS XP2** - sameline with ABUS XP2s as the only difference is the hollow anti-bump pin in one of the stacks of XP2s.
- **Bravus 1000/2000** - sameline with Bravus 3000. Bravus 1000 and 2000 are picking-wise identical to 3000 as the only difference is passive pinning.
- **Ruko DP2** - Sameline with ASSA DP10 because it is the same lock.

- **ABUS Pfaffenhain Standard** - split:
  - 5 pin, spools only - ORANGE. Arguably they are very precise but the old standard pinning is 2 spools and 3 regular making it easier.
  - 5 pin, new pinning or 6 pin - remains GREEN.

- **ABUS W14** - split:
  - 5 pin, spools only - ORANGE. Profile makes the pins very accessible and pins don't require a lot of lift.
  - 5 pin with new pinning or 6 pin - remains GREEN.

- **ABUS K/X W14** - split:
  - with less than 5 side elements - GREEN. The profile just makes it rather easy to pick even with a few side elements.
  - with 5 side elements - remains BLUE.

- **ABUS K/X V14** - split:
  - with less than 3 side elements - GREEN. There is not a lot of difference to the normal V14 if there is only 1 or 2 side elements.
  - with >= 3 side elements - remains BLUE.

- **ABUS Integral** - split:
  - with less than 6 main pins or less than 5 side elements - remains GREEN.
  - with 6 pins and at least 5 side elements - BLUE. Aligns with ratings of W14 which is very similar in construction and picking.
