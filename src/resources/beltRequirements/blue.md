Transitionary phase in your mastery. You are leaving the relative calm and
predictable world of standard locks behind and dipping a toe into the
strange and bizarre world of high-security locks. You are frequently
pinning your own locks, making challenge locks, and helping newer members
of the lockpicking community as they progress.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP and gut one of the locks ranked as blue belt.

**Non-Picking Requirements**

- All previous non-picking requirements must have been fulfilled.
  - Demonstrate your ability to gut locks and get them back together again. *(Green Belt Requirement)*
- Demonstrated history of helping new pickers, either on the sub and/or
   in the Discord channel.
- Have built a "Challenge Lock" and shared it with a fellow picker. Please see below for more
   information on this requirement.

Note: If picking an SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core), be sure to review the guidelines listed under SFIC Filming Requirements for validating
your lock in the picking video. Please read more below for filming requirements.

**Evidence Format**

- Pick and gut in a continuous video take without cuts, keeping the lock in frame.
