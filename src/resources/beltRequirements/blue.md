Transitionary phase in your mastery. You are leaving the relative calm and predictable world of standard locks behind and dipping a toe into the strange and bizarre world of high-security locks. You are frequently pinning your own locks, doing advanced projects, and helping newer members of the lockpicking community as they progress.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP and gut one of the locks ranked as Blue Belt.

- *Note:* If picking an SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core), be sure to review the guidelines listed under SFIC Filming Requirements for validating your lock in the picking video. Please see/click below for the "SFIC Filming Requirements" section with detailed information.

**Picking Evidence Format**

- Pick and gut in a continuous video take without cuts, keeping the lock and components in frame. Your video should include a clear close-up of the pins from the lock.

**Blue Belt Project Requirements** (Updated February 2025)

To qualify for a Blue Belt, you must also submit a project that demonstrates your growing knowledge of locks and lockpicking. **We encourage new and creative approaches to these projects**. You can choose from a variety of options, please be sure to see/click below for the "Blue Belt Project Requirements" section with more detailed information. Accepted projects include:

- Challenge Lock (CL): Modify a lock by adding security pins or other features, post about it, and share it with a fellow picker.

- Cutaway Lock: Expose the locking mechanisms of an existing lock. The lock should be completely functional with a working key.

- Lock Write-Up: Provide a detailed breakdown of a lock, its design, pins, security features, and picking techniques.

- First Public Pick of a Lock: Successfully pick a lock that has not been picked before (i.e., the first pick of a lock model, brand, or specific design).

- Combination Lock Decoded: Show a video of successfully decoding a combination lock.

- Picking Any Lever Lock with Homemade Wires: Use self-made tools to pick a lever lock.

- Homemade Tension Tool: Design and build a functional tension tool for lockpicking - note this needs to be a useful item for long-term use. #NoPaperclips.

- New Pinning Tray Designed and Made: Create a custom pinning tray for organizing lock components.

- 3D Model of a Lock: Design and share a 3D model of a lock, such as a cutaway, to aid in understanding its internals.

- *If you have an idea for another project you would like to complete thatâ€™s not listed here, contact us through modmail or #mod-requests on Discord to discuss it.*

**Project Evidence Format**

- Evidence will vary based on the project type but must be clear and comprehensive. Please include photos, videos, or other documentation as needed. Please see/click below for the "Blue Belt Request Submissions" section with detailed information.

**Additional Non-Picking Requirements**

- Demonstrated history of helping new pickers, either on the sub and/or in the Discord channel.
- All previous non-picking requirements must have been fulfilled:
  - Demonstrated your ability to gut locks and get them back together again. *(Green Belt Requirement)*
