Higher quality locks with even more security pins. Some of these locks have
dead cores, and it's not just because you've picked them to death. It might
also be that you have started down the dimple lock road. You've also started
your development as a lock surgeon, gutting them and getting them back
together again.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP (single pin pick) one of the locks ranked as Green Belt. Raking is not allowed for Green Belt and above.

**Non-Picking Requirements**

- Demonstrate your ability to gut locks.
- Demonstrate your ability to reassemble locks (the reassembly can be a different lock and even in a separate video).

**Evidence format**

- You must **video** picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take, **pictures are no longer accepted at this rank**, even for locks that cannot be disassembled. Your video should include a clear close-up of the pins from the lock.
- For locks that cannot be gutted -- e.g. Master Lock #410 LOTO -- video documentation of gutting a different lock will be accepted.
- You can document the reassembly skill with a different lock and even in a separate video, you do not have to reassemble in the same take.
- The lock you reassemble doesn't have to be the same lock you gutted.
- Reassembly evidence is only required once for Green Belt, and is not required for further submissions. 
- Please, please be sure to read the **[video submission guidelines](/#/info?id=video-requirements)** before submitting your video.
