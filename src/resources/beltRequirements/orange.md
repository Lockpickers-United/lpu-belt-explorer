Those security pins designed to keep you out are powerless against you. You're starting to find locks containing them easier to pick than those without. Your family is also starting to look at you and your growing collection of locks a bit strangely. It's OK -- we understand you. Let's get an orange belt on you to confuse them further.

**Requirements**

- Pick one of the locks ranked as Orange Belt.

**Details**

- If the lock can be dissasembled, you must single pin pick (SPP) it and submit a **video** of your picking accomplishments for this rank. Videos must be in one continuous take.
- For locks that cannot be disassembled, raking is allowed and photographs showing the turned core are sufficient.
