Those security pins designed to keep you out are powerless against you. You're starting to find locks containing them easier to pick than those without. Your family is also starting to look at you and your growing collection of locks a bit strangely. It's OK -- we understand you. Let's get an orange belt on you to confuse them further.

**Requirements**

- Pick one of the locks ranked as orange belt.

**Evidence format**

- You must submit a **video** of your picking accomplishments for this rank unless the lock cannot be disassembled. Videos must be in one continuous take.
- Photographs showing the turned core are sufficient for locks that cannot be disassembled.
