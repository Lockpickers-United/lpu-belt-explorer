You are entering the realm of ultra high-security locks and becoming a
pillar of the lockpicking community. You find yourself picking locks that
are so difficult tools sometimes don't even exist to open them, requiring
you make your own. Tight keyways, rotating sidebar fingers, telescoping
keypins, and countermilling are the norm for you.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP (single pin pick) and gut **two** different locks ranked as Brown Belt (locks have to be from separate entries in the list).

**Non-Picking Requirements**

- Complete a Project/Quest at **Tier 1** level or above.
  - **[Click here](https://lpubelts.com/#/projects)** for Project types and requirements details.

- All previous non-picking requirements must have been fulfilled:
  - Demonstrated your ability to gut locks and get them back together again. *(Green Belt Requirement)*
  - Demonstrated history of helping new pickers, either on the sub and/or in the Discord channel. *(Blue Belt Requirement)*
  - Built a "Challenge Lock" or completed similar project. *(Blue Belt Requirement)*

**Evidence Format**

- Pick and gut in a continuous video take without cuts, keeping the lock and components in frame.
