You are now picking locks that are categorically hi-sec. They have two or
more discrete locking mechanisms and are considered unpickable by nearly
every locksmith on the planet. You are helping new pickers frequently
and sharing challenge locks.

You must video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP (single pin pick) and gut **two** different locks ranked as Purple Belt (locks have to be from separate entries in the list).

**Non-Picking Requirements**

- All previous non-picking requirements must have been fulfilled:
  - Demonstrated your ability to gut locks and get them back together again. *(Green Belt Requirement)*
  - Demonstrated history of helping new pickers, either on the sub and/or in the Discord channel. *(Blue Belt Requirement)*
  - Built a "Challenge Lock" and shared it with a fellow picker. *(Blue Belt Requirement)*

**Evidence Format**

- Pick and gut in a continuous video take without cuts, keeping the lock in frame.

Note: If picking an SFIC (Small Format Interchangeable Core), be sure to review the guidelines listed under SFIC Filming Requirements for validating
your lock in the picking video. Please read more below for filming requirements.
