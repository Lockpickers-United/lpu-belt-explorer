Ultra-high security is your middle name. Your lock collection is worth more than your first car, and you constantly troll eBay for deals on insane European locks. You are frequently making custom tools to pick difficult locks, and you are acting as a mentor to folks at the blue, purple and brown belt levels.

**Picking Requirements**

- SPP (single pin pick) and gut **two** different locks ranked as Red Belt (locks have to be from separate entries in the list).

**Non-Picking Requirements**

- Mentor a more advanced picker through the process of getting into a difficult lock.
- All previous non-picking requirements must have been fulfilled:
  - Demonstrated your ability to gut locks and get them back together again. *(Green Belt Requirement)*
  - Demonstrated history of helping new pickers, either on the sub and/or in the Discord channel. *(Blue Belt Requirement)*
  - Built a "Challenge Lock" or completed similar project. *(Blue Belt Requirement)*
  - Complete a Project/Quest at Tier 1 level or above. *(Brown Belt Requirement)*

**Evidence Format**

- Pick and gut in a continuous video take without cuts, keeping the lock and components in frame. Your video should include a clear close-up of the pins from the lock. Note: videos must be in **horizontal** aspect ratio due to the detailed review that Red Belt evidence recieves. Videos shot vertically will be rejected without review.
