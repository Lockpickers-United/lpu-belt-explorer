Ultra high security is your middle name. Your lock collection is worth more than
your first car and you constantly troll eBay for deals on insane European locks.
You are frequently making custom tools to pick difficult locks, and you are acting
as a mentor to folks at the blue, purple and brown belt levels.

You must video picking and gutting accomplishments in one continuous take.

Requirements:

1. Demonstrate your ability to gut locks and get them back together again
2. Demonstrated history of helping advancing and advanced pickers
3. Have built a Challenge Lock and shared it with a fellow picker
4. Have made at least one specialized tool
5. Mentor a more advanced picker through the process of getting into a difficult lock
6. SPP and gut two different locks on this list (locks have to be from separate
   lines on the list) or similar
