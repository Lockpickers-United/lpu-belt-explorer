## Current Belt Rankings List

### LPU Belt Explorer

The Lock Pickers United [Belt Explorer](https://lpubelts.com/) is a new tool that lets you explore the belt rankings list. Every lock for every belt is described with its locking mechanisms and other features. Many of the locks have photo galleries as well as notes about the lock and strategies for picking. Need to know which Master Locks are a good next step from white belt? Only interested in dimple locks? Blue-belt disc detainers? The LPU Belt Explorer is the thing for you. **[Check it out!](https://lpubelts.com/)**
