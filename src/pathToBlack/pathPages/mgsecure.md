>Another list from the LPUbelts team. Here’s a slightly different take than the path I actually took, focusing on [dimple locks](/#/locks?tab=search&lockingMechanisms=Dimple). I did use them from Purple to Black and they are a fascinating and challenging switch from “traditional” pin-tumbler locks.

>For those who might want to start exploring picking dimples, here’s an [overview of major dimple flag sets](https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/teonid/dimple_lock_pick_set_info_comparison_multipick/) I put together a bit back. I use the Multipick flags, and included some tool selection notes below.

>(Some more notes here about non-ranked locks)

- Kenaurd is a house brand at UHS Hardware and this lock doesn’t contain spooled or serrated outer pins. Their 1” mortice lock has four pins while 1 1/8” and longer come with five. Pin-in-Pin "sounds" scary' at first but they’re really not that much harder than standard pins.
- I use the Multipick #7 and small #10 which were designed for PIP locks but a standard flag works well too. The [ABUS D6](/#/locks?id=f97700ff&name=ABUS_D6) seems like a popular option in the UK.  (I actually submitted the pin-tumbler [ABUS 72/40](/#/locks?id=74a00ae3&name=ABUS_72_40).)

- Another house brand from UHS, though any [HQ High Security Interactive clone](/#/locks?id=c1d09460&name=Any_HQ_High_Security_Interactive_clone) will do. This is a step up from the Kenaurd in that it contains PIP spooled security pins. I generally prefer security pins for the feedback they give and this lock has decently deep spools. Again with the MP #7 and 10. You could also go with a four pin [Mul-T-Lock Classic/Interactive](/#/locks?id=aec0c82d&name=MulTLock_Classic) or an [ ABUS 75/50](/#/locks?id=9ec8706c&name=ABUS_75_50) padlock for Blue. (I actually submitted the [American Lock 1100](/#/locks?id=2ae1e0b8&name=American_Lock_1100___A1100) which used to be Blue.)

- Starting at Purple, you need to submit **two** different locks for each belt. My second one was the [**DeGuard Interactive clone**](/#/locks?id=db4de1bb). They are similar, five pin-in-pin stack locks. The MTL locks definitely have tighter tolerances and the Junior is a good introduction to them. There are a lot of other [Purple Belt dimple locks](/#/locks?tab=Purple&lockingMechanisms=Dimple) if these aren't available in your area.

- And the [**Mul-T-Lock Interactive**](/#/locks?id=5c5701d7&name=MulTLock_Classic) (serrated driver pins). MTL locks are tougher with serrated drivers but not dramatically harder. The Japanese GOAL D9 however, is a real big shift in approach and difficulty. This cute little lock has three rows of pins with three pins each and is a great introduction to so-called "High Pin Count" (HPC) locks. Progressive pinning is a really great way to learn these, I start with the pins in the back and add in groups of three. Trying with just one full row is also a good way to get a feel for things. The [WEST 916](/#/locks?id=18e1f45b&name=WEST_916) is another good Brown Belt HPC lock. It has two rows of six pins each on both sides.

- And [**ABUS EC700/EC800**](/#/locks?id=b29a8b44&name=ABUS_EC700). The MIWA JN has four rows of pins, two on the sides and two coming in diagonally from the bottom. It is capable of having up to 21 pins but counts for Red with 14. It's similar to other HPC locks like the [GOAL v18](/#/locks?id=9f613c4a) but doesn't have over-milling in the core. I use the same curved flag approach here.

- 109531f4
- And the [**WEST 917**](/#/locks?id=23437955&name=WEST_917). The V18 is a beast of a lock with three rows of pins and up to 19 active pin stacks. It has over-milling in the core that creates overset traps if you aren't careful. It is Black Belt with 14-16 pins and BB2 with all 19. Under some peer pressure, I picked it with 19 :-) Patience is key and progressive pinning really helped me tackle it. I can't keep track of all 19 pins at once, so I broke it down into zones like "back left" and "front right" to help me picture it.
