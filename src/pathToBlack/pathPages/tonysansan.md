>Let me tell you about a little-known problem in locksport. Some of us find it hard to resist filling up our workspace with drawers full of tools and buckets overflowing with locks, eliciting fear from our bank accounts and alarm from our loved ones. The LPU Belt System came to my rescue, with one simple additional rule: I vowed to only buy new lock stuff upon being granted the next belt. This led to some interesting lock choices over the course of my journey, which I now present for your entertainment.

- 2455f0ae
- I’m glad I put my gritty white belt [Master Lock #1](/#/locks?id=5a91e6a5) aside for the [Master Lock 140](/#/locks?id=2455f0ae). What a perfect first lock. Although I didn’t know any better at the time, I got one with standard driver pins (look for the 1234BC stamp). Clear, crisp feedback that taught me the basics. My tools were junk, but as I acquired more, I would always go back to my 140 to try out a new pick or tensioner. 

- 632f4069
- I got my first legit pick set from Law Lock Tools, with some TOK pry bars that I soon grew to love. The [ABUS 55/40](/#/locks?id=632f4069) is a gentle introduction to spools. I learned about true binding order as I worked out how to pick this lock while avoiding false sets.

- 74a00ae3
- Two things were bothering me. First, I wasn’t able to take any of my locks apart to see how they work. And second, I couldn’t understand why folks cared about pick thickness. The [ABUS 72/40](/#/locks?id=74a00ae3) is both a challenging first reassemble (long springs) and has a tight keyway that encourages thinner pick choices. Of course, I needed to acquire all the gutting tools and a whole new set of picks to really get to the bottom of this thickness thing.

- f97700ff
- Locks are starting to look weirder, and I was eager to see what dimples were all about. The [ABUS D6](/#/locks?id=74a00ae3) was ranked blue at the time, but more importantly it was easy to acquire. I needed flags, so my whole green belt reward budget went to the epic MultiPick set. Buy once and cry once... these flags have stayed with me for my whole journey.

- 41f9efa2
- Because the MP flags set me back so much, I kept it on the cheap for purple, as these locks are easy to come by in the US. While not strictly necessary, I learned to float pick on the [Kwikset SmartKey Gen 1](/#/locks?id=41f9efa2), which proved to be a valuable skill for the future. And I made my first tool (sidebar shim) for the [Kwikset SmartKey Gen 3](/#/locks?id=06ddb074), which gave me some confidence in thinking outside the box -- and which failed to impress me with how powerful a reverse sidebar can be when implemented correctly.

- 5329b0f3
- Magnets! While it doesn’t require much skill to glue a magnet onto a piece of metal, this was my first custom pick.  And the [Ankerslot Infinity K](/#/locks?id=5329b0f3) that I used it on was my first euro cylinder, so I learned the joy of segmented followers (related to the joy of bricking). The [Mako M-2 SFIC](/#/locks?id=b13f4b57) was a great bit of fun working both shear lines with all the crazy driver pins in there. And my biggest lesson in humility didn’t make my belt request: I had bought a [LIPS Octro](/#/locks?id=514c7ec4) high pin count lock, but botched the gutting so badly that I had to come back to it later. 

- b8350901
- I realized I’ve been avoiding things that rotate, like discs and pins. And I really wanted to get my toolmaking game on. So, enter the [ABUS Plus (with butterflies!)](/#/locks?id=b8350901), for which I stocked up on hardware and made a custom nose for the Sparrows disc detainer pick. And welcome the [Corbin Russwin Emhart](/#/locks?id=c4f942f0), for which I played with all sorts of notched picks (stock and custom) to turn those pins.

- 104776ef
- Close to black, I was feeling self-conscious about my gaps, so I found 4 locks to cover some bases. I chose the [ASSA Twin 6000](/#/locks?id=104776ef) for the infamous gin drivers, [Abloy Sentry](/#/locks?id=2ae6a691) so I could make a custom disc detainer pick, [EVVA 3KS](/#/locks?id=f7452b9f) for a real slider lock (very different than Kwikset), and the [Tann Detector](/#/locks?id=69668831) for my first lever lock. So it was that at the end of my belt journey, I found my favorite lock. I have since picked every lever lock I could get my hands on, and the hundred fancy picks I’ve acquired sit in drawers as I make my tools from cheap piano wire. It turns out I don’t have a good solution for the drawers and the buckets. But for me the lesson is that if you steer towards things that are new and interesting, you may be surprised by what goodness you find. Good luck on your journey!

>They didn’t let me into the dojo with just 4 black belt locks. I also cracked the [S&G 6741](/#/dials?id=8a2dc6e5&name=Sargent__Greenleaf_6741) combination lock. It’s a bit mind blowing to a pick a lock with graph paper.

>**Beyond Black Belt**

>We rank black belt locks by five levels, and the engineering marvels that are the [Black Belt 5 locks](#/locks?tab=search&filterBelts=Black+5) have both fun to offer and patience to teach. See how crossing a disc detainer with a pump lock gives you the [Fichet F3D](/#/locks?id=c0af45f4). Put a reverse sidebar to good use by overpowering the springs for a dozen sliders in the [Yuema 750](/#/locks?id=0b604114). And there are so many of my favorite lever locks, with all the tricks they can do... Share a leaf spring across levers so one requires great force and its neighbor will overset when you brush against it ([Western Electric 30B](/#/locks?id=e718b140)), or employ a blocker that locks the levers in place before their gates can be tested ([Western Electric 30C](/#/locks?id=5a4310d5)). The NATO Mersey takes the opposite approach, locking everything up for applying too much tension, requiring creative compression and tilting to either avoid brutal false gates ([10 lever Mersey](/#/locks?id=4f2ed774)) or to herd all the levers in place without dropping any ([14 lever Mersey](/#/locks?id=f29a212f)). And then we have the Kromer Protector, where touching anything can impact everything else, and even the simpler models ([non-BP55K Kromer Protector](/#/locks?id=50a463eb)) are formidable. Throw in some curtains and a lot more split wafers and you have the [BP55K Kromer Protector](/#/locks?id=f87db705), which in my experience is the hardest lock to pick out of all the currently ranked BB5s. So there is good news ahead -- the road surely does not end at black!
