>Hello! I started completely fresh to lock picking in December 2023 after a gift of a CI genesis kit with practice lock after expressing some interest in it. Otherwise, I was in the middle of finishing my degree with just about 1 year left till I was done, so this didn’t get my absolute full attention.

- b22bdd44
- The only lock that I did for this was really my CI practice lock trainer. And, well, I wouldn’t recommend it knowing what I do now it did make it really approachable to try pinning and get the initial feel of a lock. In this I practiced until I could do 5–6 pins with serrated and spools and mixtures within the first couple days of having my kit.

- My first "actual" lock was the good ol' ML150. Nothing but good spools in here with a standard. I did this around a day or two after getting my practice lock. This lock really cemented what I was “guessing” about spools from the practice lock, and I think I got it open within the first 1 or 2 days that I played with it, cementing my first submitted belt to the discord

- 2ae1e0b8
- I did three locks for this with my first being the American Lock 1100. This lock was my first green belt lock that I immediately started to try to tackle after the ML150. It greeted me warmly with an open in the first 30 minutes which I then got promptly punished with all future attempts taking 1–2 hours. This really cemented spools, but otherwise I was “feeling” but not really understanding the nuances of the pin states. It also was the first lock I bricked completely during reassembly, teaching me a valuable lesson. After picking this lock, I promptly ordered multiple replacement cores, an ABUS 72/40 and multiple used Master Lock 410s.
- [**ABUS 72/40**](/#/locks?id=74a00ae3): Extremely fun lock to play with giving great spool feedback with some generosity on setting order of the spools. At this point I was cycling through multiple AL1100 and the ML410s, so while fun, it didn’t teach me anything new at this point.
- [**Master Lock 410 LOTO**](/#/locks?id=c942490e): This lock I received was used and gunky but extremely cheap. This lock put up quite a fight being dirty and gave subtle feedback and extremely deep sets for the spools. Paired with a tighter keyway than I was used to at this point made this one of the harder locks I had at the time. I had three that I cycled through until I could get them consistently.

- This lock can also be referenced as the big cousin to the AL1100. Nothing new learned, but at this point I understood what set vs. unset was and consistently identifying that in locks I was picking. That made this lock a good challenge. I think it took me a few hours to get open the day that I picked it up.

- First, I tried to apply direct sidebar tension through the change key port, but that I find is much harder than shimming, but was the first lock that required me to build a tool for. For this lock if you build a shim, you can get away with memorizing where you should place the sliders and the shim will then insert further. At this point I didn’t really understand slider feedback as I was just reacting to shim/tension feedback. (I have since revisited this lock and GenI/II since I enjoy sliders and found it much, much easier)

- This lock took me a few weeks with me really enjoying CCW feedback and getting my ass kicked by a front barrel that would drop all the previous stacks. This lock was my first foray into actually understanding slider feedback by way of the sidebar mechanism, with the top stacks being difficult but not overly so.

- This lock is fun. That being said, I love using heavy tension, but my lock really preferred extremely light tension. This lock required a light touch and gave great feedback and really gave me a run for my money. As well as losing the small ball bearings, I would recommend this lock to anybody who wants an extremely pure PT experience without the cost of multiple days of their sanity. This lock is where it finally cemented pin states and what I was feeling in the lock while picking. This lock was extremely fun to pick.

- I picked this lock up keyless as I thought it would be a fun challenge and worked on it on/off during getting my brown/purple belt. (I didn’t record it, so I didn’t use it to submit for brown). This lock taught me a ton about sliders, and I would recommend it to anybody who eventually wants to do things like ASSA 6k, Assa V10 or multilock. This lock ate up many hours of frustration because I couldn’t PP the lock. Eventually getting it open made me feel less like a fraud (I could actually open a difficult lock without the key.) It was a completely different mechanism to what I was familiar with at this point.

- I skipped Red, but I did pick one unrecorded for prep for my black belt locks. No, I did not enjoy this lock I had to PP it to open it once, then I had to PP it again to open it another time. I do not enjoy this lock, but it did somewhat cement gin states into my head, and it also taught me I like sliders better than the nonsense PT is at BB levels. That aside, it is a great lock to learn gins on, and it does not hold back at all and really makes you work for open you get on it. I would recommend it for learning, but it's not a lock I like coming back to.

2. I picked four black belt locks for my application, you’ll probably notice a slight trend in what type of lock I tackled with hopefully the previous Brown/Red painting a picture. With one quest which was safecracking which has a completely separate writeup which is ok to link here that said let's get into the locks.

- This lock was my first black belt lock picked\! In this I had to progressively pick both elements of the lock so sidebar and top stack separately, taking I think 2–3 weeks to get my first open. The sidebar is slider-based and extremely tight tolerances. It has similar feedback to the Desmo for pin state luckily my top/side stack isolated to once I got my bearing on barrels and the sidebar, this actually wasn’t too bad of a lock to pick. My first recorded open was 1+ hours that needed a refilm that I shaved down to 13 minutes.  This lock is fun if you like the sidebar mechanism and don’t mind getting past the barrels.

- This lock was my second Black Belt lock. At this point I only needed to progressively pin the top stack as I understood the sidebar mechanism at this point. After that it was actually a relatively fun pick with some mixed sidebar/top stack picking. If you’re unfamiliar, this lock picks in three states. First, setting the gins into their milling → setting the sidebar → setting the gin heads. Mine didn’t isolate perfectly, so I would have to tackle the sidebar again after dropping some sidepins while setting gin heads. This was a fun lock and doesn’t require true floating as the sidebar has a spring\!. If you understand gins and don’t mind the difficulty of the sidebar, this is a fun pick.

- By now you may have seen a pattern in the sidebar mechanism I got comfortable with. This was my fastest open and required no PP. Nothing really new learned here, and this lock is easier than the ASSA 6k twin barrels as the top stack is extremely similar and the sidebar doesn’t require any precise float picking to secure an open. If you like the previous two locks, this one is easy to pop open.

- 5103e650
- This lock was a quite fun challenge requiring me to take a step back and really cement in feeling set vs spool feedback as the torpedo keypins are killer in this lock. You can still set some top stacks after getting set in a torpedo, which can result in a loop you can’t pick out of. This lock is also a lot of small ping-ponging the pin up past the milling and was quite a relief to get into as I was trying to get everything recorded.

2. I will say anytime you get a first open while recording these black belt locks is extremely nerve-wracking and refilms are not fun and sometimes take longer than the initial filming. It is a rush to get the open and finally be able to use it for the BB app.

>This whole journey to Black Belt was from Christmas 2023 through May 24th 2024. I will say if you’re worried about price, the journey I took was specifically made with that in mind (poor college student.) The priciest lock being Goal Z (70$) at the time of purchase, which I sold back to buy more new locks with most locks purple+ averaging around 30$ a lock. Which is on the cheaper side for BB locks. After I got BB I have branched out into some HPC dimples (I don’t enjoy them as much). DD locks (Quite fun but need a toolmaking station) and tackled more slider-based locks including Multilock and Miwa U9. If you need U9 help, feel free to DM me on Discord. It is probably my favorite lock at this point.
