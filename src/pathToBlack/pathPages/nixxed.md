>This is the beginning of what we plan to be a series of posts sharing a "Path to Black" from an experienced picker. Here's one approach I put together that only uses traditional pin-tumbler locks, the first of a few lists by folks on the LPUbelts team.

- This is a great padlock to practice with early on. It's repinnable, so you can buy security pins and practice just like the Sparrows practice locks, except this one has real lock feedback. Default pinning is going to be light serrated in stack 1 and the rest spools. After you're bored with the core, you can swap any standard KIK into this and pick in hand!

- The classic. This comes highly recommended for good reason. Great tension and jiggle test practice to warm you up for blue.

- Australian classic. Five thin lipped spools for a really fun pick. This should help round out your tension practice for purple!

- Barrels are rough, but without a sidebar this is doable! Progressive pin will be your friend here and up, and you'll see why barrels are so effective at 3-4+ stacks.

- Fun spools and gins to start to really challenge you. Not many PTs make it to this belt level without a secondary locking mechanism. This will warm you up for red.

- A red belted Goal Z is just one pin from a Black lock! Amazing tolerances, different shaped spools, and gins with matching milling. Round that off with overmilling as well for a big challenge. You likely can get an extra pin to make this black as well!

- The classic PT Black experience. Shoot for the ideal pinning if possible, should be tapers in 3/5/7, with 2+ trees and rest gins. If you can get it grubbed, do it! It makes the gutting/PP experience much safer and basically unbrickable.
