# Five is Binding

>*Editors note: Not a Path to Black, but a **six** lock Black Belt submission from back in the day when those were rare. Five is Binding may no longer be active, but his all ASSA Twin request is legendary. Keep in mind that each lock needs to be from it's own line/entry in the ranking list! I've put this together from his request and posts on Discord.*

> From hardest to less hardest:

- c8694f3a
- [V-10 w/ gins](/#/locks?id=c8694f3a) - It didn't isolate sides. Complicated learning to partially set the sidebar, push up gins, finish sidebar, float remaining gins. Also, a more restrictive keyway.

- 104776ef
- [6k w/gins](/#/locks?id=104776ef) - Did isolate sides. The 6k sidebar sometimes requires carefully backing off tension to lift the sidepins to the next gate. Setting gin spools without dropping sidepins required a lot of precision and practice.

- 7168d463
- [Twin Combi](/#/locks?id=7168d463) - Mine isolated but I hear many do not. The finger pins gave good feedback for determining the pin states. Required some tension finesse to turn the finger pins when they were binding hard. Keyway allowed for a .025 pick to set the barrels.

- 55053299
- [Twin 6k (barrels)](/#/locks?id=55053299) - Isolated sides. This was less hard than the gin version because dropping barrels while setting the sidebar wasn't a problem. The sidebar is still trickier to execute than the V-10 or the Baltic versions.

- 3f73d2ce
- [Twin V-10 (barrels)](/#/locks?id=3f73d2ce) - Isolated sides. The sidepins can be pushed up without having to back off tension much like the 6k. The keyway is more restrictive making the barrels more challenging to pick than the Baltic.

- f7ad4c89
- [Baltic Twin Exclusive](/#/locks?id=f7ad4c89) - Isolated sides. The sidebar picked similar to the V-10, perhaps requiring a bit more tension variation. But the keyway is more open and allowed for a .025 pick, making for a less hard time picking the barrels.
