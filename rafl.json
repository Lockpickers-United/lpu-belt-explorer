    "description": "Fun-loving weirdos, incorrigible min-maxers, folks who enjoy playing with puzzles, pushing boundaries, and picking the occasional lock: do you have Little Pick Energy? CollateralTech sure has! Instead of filming for Green Belt, CT has been up late laboring out of love and lunacy, trying to jam over two dozen locksport tools into a condom wrapper. The result? A nifty fifty-fifty mixture of hooks and rakes with enough tools to cover most basic pin-tumbler locks and then some. The condom wrapper idea didn't pan out, but the finished package easily fits inside an American 1100 box. Put your RAFL tickets down to win some locks, some fun swag, and an updated copy of CT's original pint-sized passion project, the Stuffed Sparrow.",
